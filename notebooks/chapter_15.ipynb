That sounds powerful. It’s also where most event-driven research quietly goes off the rails.\n","\n","This notebook is designed to teach event-driven trading the way you would need to build it in a real research or institutional setting: as a **time-aware pipeline** with **governance baked in**, not as a magical “sentiment model” that spits out alpha because we fed it headlines. The main point is simple: in event-driven trading, the hardest part is usually not language. It’s **time**—specifically, proving what was knowable when.\n","\n","**Why event-driven is different from price-based features**\n","\n","Prices come with a relatively clean clock. A daily close is a daily close. A return from today to tomorrow is well-defined. News is messier. A headline can have:\n","\n","- a time when the underlying event happened (real world),\n","- a time when a vendor published it (media world),\n","- a time when your system first saw it (systems world),\n","- and a time when your strategy can realistically use it (trading world).\n","\n","Most “sentiment backtests” accidentally collapse all of these into one timestamp and then join it to daily returns. That’s how you get beautiful, fake performance—because your features silently include information that would only be available **after** your decision time.\n","\n","So this notebook’s primary learning goal is not “how to do sentiment.” It’s:  \n","**how to build an event signal that obeys causality and can survive an audit.**\n","\n","**What you’ll build in this notebook**\n","\n","We will create a full end-to-end event-driven research pipeline using **synthetic data** (on purpose). Synthetic data lets us control the truth, stress-test leakage, and learn the mechanics without getting distracted by vendor quirks or API limits. The workflow looks like this:\n","\n","1. **A synthetic market**  \n","   We generate a multi-asset return series with changing volatility conditions (quiet vs stressed periods). This gives us a realistic environment: clustering, bursts, and regime-like behavior—without relying on external data.\n","\n","2. **A synthetic event feed with realistic timing problems**  \n","   We generate events for each asset and attach multiple timestamps: when it happened, when it was published, when we first “saw” it, and when we are allowed to treat it as “known.” This is crucial. The entire notebook revolves around using the *known-time* concept properly.\n","\n","3. **An immutable event log and a canonical event ledger**  \n","   We store events as an append-only log (like a real ingestion pipeline) and then build a standardized ledger with consistent schema, stable identifiers, deduplication keys, and instrument mapping fields. This is the governance backbone: it makes the data inspectable and reproducible.\n","\n","4. **Transparent text-to-number features (no magic)**  \n","   We do not use black-box NLP here. We start with a simple, interpretable lexicon approach (a dictionary of words/phrases with positive/negative weights), plus basic handling of negation and intensifiers. The point is to keep the pipeline explainable: you should be able to answer, “Why did the model think this headline was negative?”\n","\n","5. **Causal aggregation into trading features**  \n","   Headlines do not become signals by themselves. We aggregate them over time into features you can trade on: counts over recent windows, novelty-weighted counts, and decayed sentiment flows. Importantly, these features are computed **only from events whose known-time is earlier than the decision time**.\n","\n","6. **A decision-time backtest (Chapter 06 discipline)**  \n","   The backtest is built around the question: “What could the strategy have known at time t?” We simulate decisions on a grid (daily, in this notebook) and impose a conservative execution delay. This is where many event strategies fail in real life—timing dominates. We want the backtest to reflect that reality.\n","\n","7. **Event study diagnostics that are trading-relevant**  \n","   We don’t do event studies as academic ornament. We use them to understand impact timing: does the market react instantly, or is there drift you could realistically capture? We also estimate a practical “half-life” of impact: how long the effect persists after the first tradable decision.\n","\n","8. **Placebo tests that catch fake edges**  \n","   Two placebo tests are included because they are essential in event work:\n","   - **Timestamp placebo:** randomize event times within buckets to break true timing alignment.\n","   - **Text shuffle placebo:** shuffle the text while keeping timing, to see if “sentiment” is really doing anything.\n","   \n","   If your strategy survives the wrong placebo, you’re probably trading on an artifact.\n","\n","9. **Robustness splits (time and source)**  \n","   We test whether performance holds out-of-sample in time, and whether it depends on a specific source. In real datasets, vendor changes and source composition shifts are major drivers of failure.\n","\n","10. **Governance artifacts and a run manifest**  \n","   At the end, we produce a manifest that records seeds, config, hashes of inputs/outputs, and a registry of artifacts (ledger, snapshots, features, traces, robustness logs). This is how you make your research reproducible and defensible.\n","\n","**What you should take away**\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you should be able to explain (in plain language):\n","\n","- why event-driven trading is fundamentally a **timestamp and causality** problem,\n","- how to define and enforce “known-at” rules so your backtest is not cheating,\n","- how to build simple, transparent sentiment features that you can audit,\n","- how to test whether you are trading on meaning, timing, or coverage artifacts,\n","- and how to package your results with governance so they can be trusted.\n","\n","If you’re an MBA/MFin student, this notebook teaches you how institutional research is *supposed* to be done when the data is messy. If you’re a practitioner, it gives you a blueprint for building an event pipeline that doesn’t collapse the first time a vendor changes a field name or a feed arrives late.\n","\n","The goal isn’t to prove that “sentiment works.” The goal is to learn the disciplined workflow that lets you discover—honestly—whether any event-driven signal is real, tradable, and robust enough to belong in a portfolio.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"J4vZ5hJ7wMcH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"K-NTSnvAnKrw"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###2.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"V2E8F8HdxMPa"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","The first cells of this notebook establish the foundational infrastructure for\n","a governance-native, causality-aware event-driven trading system. These cells are\n","designed with a singular philosophy: every decision must be traceable, reproducible,\n","and temporally sound. They create the deterministic environment and transparent\n","sentiment measurement tools that will later process synthetic news events and convert\n","them into tradable signals.\n","\n","**Establishing Deterministic Governance**\n","\n","The opening cell constructs a rigorous operational framework centered on three pillars:\n","determinism, configuration management, and artifact governance.\n","\n","**Determinism** is achieved through explicit random seed control. The seed value\n","(15_2025) is set globally for both Python's random module and NumPy, ensuring that\n","every stochastic process—from market simulation to event generation—produces identical\n","results across runs. This isn't merely convenient for debugging; it's essential for\n","regulatory compliance and scientific reproducibility. When a trading strategy produces\n","unexpected results, practitioners must be able to replay the exact sequence of events\n","that led to those outcomes.\n","\n","**Configuration management** takes the form of a frozen dataclass that serves as the\n","single source of truth for all system parameters. This Config object encapsulates\n","everything from market structure (12 assets over 600 days) to subtle behavioral\n","parameters like sentiment decay half-lives and event clustering probabilities. The\n","immutability (frozen=True) prevents accidental parameter drift during execution.\n","Rather than scattering magic numbers throughout the codebase, this design centralizes\n","all tunable parameters, making sensitivity analysis and parameter optimization\n","straightforward and auditable.\n","\n","The configuration includes sophisticated temporal parameters that reflect real-world\n","market mechanics. For instance, the decision hour is set to 21:00 UTC (roughly US\n","market close), while execution delays and processing buffers model the realistic lag\n","between information arrival and tradable action. These aren't arbitrary choices—they\n","encode domain knowledge about how news propagates through financial markets.\n","\n","**Artifact governance** is implemented through a comprehensive suite of utility\n","functions that handle cryptographic hashing and serialization. Every piece of data\n","produced by the system—from event logs to feature matrices to backtest results—is\n","saved with a deterministic SHA-256 hash. This creates an immutable audit trail where\n","the integrity of any artifact can be verified instantly. The hash-based lineage\n","tracking means that if a feature matrix produces unexpected signals, practitioners\n","can trace back through the entire computational graph to identify where assumptions\n","diverged from reality.\n","\n","The governance helpers also standardize datetime handling, forcing all timestamps\n","into UTC with ISO 8601 formatting ending in 'Z'. This eliminates timezone ambiguity—\n","a common source of look-ahead bias in event-driven systems when events timestamped\n","in one timezone are compared against decision times in another.\n","\n","**Transparent Lexicon-Based Sentiment Measurement**\n","\n","The second part of the code implements a deliberately simple but transparent approach to\n","extracting numerical sentiment from text. Unlike black-box machine learning models,\n","this lexicon-based system makes every scoring decision explicit and auditable.\n","\n","**The lexicon itself** is a versioned dictionary mapping words to sentiment weights.\n","Positive terms like \"beat,\" \"upgrade,\" and \"raises\" carry positive weights (+2.0,\n","+2.0, +2.0), while negative terms like \"miss,\" \"downgrade,\" and \"cuts\" carry\n","corresponding negative weights. The magnitudes reflect domain expertise about which\n","words signal meaningful price movements in financial news. The lexicon is versioned\n","(LEX_v1_simple_domain) because sentiment semantics evolve—what signaled strength\n","in 2015 may mean something different in 2025.\n","\n","**Phrase detection** addresses the compositional nature of financial language. The\n","system recognizes multi-word expressions like \"raises guidance\" and \"cuts guidance\"\n","as atomic units with their own sentiment weights (+2.5 and -2.5). This prevents\n","naive token-by-token scoring from misinterpreting context. The phrase matching is\n","deterministic and operates during tokenization, before sentiment calculation begins.\n","\n","**Linguistic modifiers** add nuance through three mechanisms. Negation words (\"not,\"\n","\"never\") flip the polarity of subsequent tokens within a configurable window (3 tokens),\n","so \"not strong\" correctly receives negative sentiment. Intensifiers (\"very,\" \"highly\")\n","boost the magnitude of following sentiment-bearing words by 50%, while diminishers\n","(\"slightly,\" \"marginally\") reduce magnitude. These rules capture how humans modulate\n","meaning through modifier-word combinations.\n","\n","**Normalization and robustness** prevent pathological edge cases. The raw sentiment\n","score is divided by the square root of token count, reducing the advantage of verbose\n","documents that simply repeat sentiment words. Final scores are clipped to [-5.0, +5.0]\n","to prevent outliers from dominating downstream aggregations. These design choices\n","trade some expressive power for stability and interpretability.\n","\n","**Transparency through testing** is demonstrated via deterministic sanity checks.\n","The cell evaluates test phrases like \"Company beats estimates and raises guidance\n","strongly\" and displays both the tokenized form and numerical score. This immediate\n","feedback loop helps practitioners validate that the lexicon behaves as intended and\n","exposes any counterintuitive scoring decisions before they propagate into trading\n","signals.\n","\n","\n","\n","Together, this code create a measurement infrastructure where every number can be\n","explained in plain language. When the system eventually generates a trading signal\n","based on news events, practitioners can trace that signal back through decayed\n","aggregations, through individual event sentiments, through tokenization decisions,\n","all the way to the lexicon weights themselves. This level of transparency is rare\n","in quantitative finance but essential for systems that must withstand regulatory\n","scrutiny and survive market regime changes.\n","\n","The deterministic framework ensures that research insights translate reliably into\n","production systems. The same configuration that powers synthetic experiments can\n","govern live trading, with cryptographic hashes proving that no parameters changed\n","between environments.

The regime mechanism\n","creates heteroskedasticity—changing volatility over time—which is crucial for testing\n","whether event-driven signals maintain effectiveness across different market conditions.\n","\n","**Factor Structure and Asset Construction**\n","\n","The market includes a common factor (market return) and asset-specific idiosyncratic\n","components, mirroring the basic structure of capital asset pricing models. Each of\n","the 12 synthetic assets receives a randomly assigned beta between 0.6 and 1.4,\n","determining its sensitivity to the market factor. This beta heterogeneity ensures\n","the portfolio of assets exhibits realistic correlation structure—assets move together\n","due to the shared market factor but retain individual variation.\n","\n","Market returns themselves follow a normal distribution with a small positive drift\n","(0.02% daily) and volatility that depends on the current regime state. This drift\n","represents the equity risk premium—the expected compensation for holding risky assets.\n","\n","Idiosyncratic volatility for each asset is drawn uniformly between 0.8% and 2.0%\n","daily, creating variation in asset-specific risk. Critically, this idiosyncratic\n","volatility also responds to regime: during stressed periods, idiosyncratic volatility\n","scales up by 1.8x. This captures the empirical phenomenon that correlations increase\n","during crises not just because the market factor becomes more volatile, but because\n","asset-specific risks also amplify.\n","\n","**Price Path Generation**\n","\n","The system constructs asset returns through a classical factor model: each asset's\n","return equals its beta times the market return plus an idiosyncratic shock scaled\n","by that asset's volatility and the current regime multiplier. Returns are computed\n","in log space to ensure continuous compounding and prevent negative prices.\n","\n","Prices begin from randomly initialized levels between $20 and $150, then evolve\n","through cumulative log returns. This initialization creates realistic heterogeneity\n","in price levels, mimicking markets where different stocks trade at different absolute\n","prices. The log-return framework means prices are always positive and returns compound\n","multiplicatively, matching real asset behavior.\n","\n","**What This Synthetic Market Enables**\n","\n","By generating a controlled market with known properties, the system enables rigorous\n","testing of the event-driven strategy under various conditions. The regime-switching\n","mechanism allows evaluation of whether sentiment signals degrade during volatile\n","periods. The factor structure permits analysis of whether the strategy captures\n","alpha (idiosyncratic returns) or simply loads on beta (market exposure).\n","\n","Most importantly, the synthetic approach eliminates confounding factors present in\n","historical backtests. There's no survivorship bias because all assets exist for the\n","full sample period. There's no look-ahead bias because the data-generating process\n","is fully specified before event generation begins. The known ground truth allows\n","validation: if the strategy performs poorly in this controlled environment, it likely\n","won't succeed in the messy complexity of real markets.\n","\n","The deterministic seed ensures this entire 600-day market history with all its regime\n","transitions, return realizations, and price paths can be regenerated exactly, forming\n","the stable foundation for all subsequent event-driven analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"xf1FT5Q6y_IH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"FuFU3JSzy_vS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","# %% [Cell 3] Synthetic market generator (prices/returns + latent regimes)\n","\n","\n","def generate_market(n_days: int, n_assets: int) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Generate synthetic market with regime-switching volatility.\n","\n","    Returns:\n","        Dict with regime, mkt_ret, asset_ret, prices, betas\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Two volatility regimes: calm (0) and stressed (1)\n","    p01 = 0.03  # probability of switching from calm to stressed\n","    p10 = 0.08  # probability of switching from stressed to calm\n","\n","    regime = np.zeros(n_days, dtype=np.int64)\n","    for t in range(1, n_days):\n","        if regime[t-1] == 0:\n","            regime[t] = 1 if random.random() < p01 else 0\n","        else:\n","            regime[t] = 0 if random.random() < p10 else 1\n","\n","    # Volatility levels\n","    vol_calm = 0.006\n","    vol_stressed = 0.020\n","    mkt_vol = np.where(regime == 0, vol_calm, vol_stressed)\n","\n","    # Market returns\n","    mkt_ret = np.random.normal(loc=0.0002, scale=mkt_vol, size=n_days).astype(np.float64)\n","\n","    # Asset betas and idiosyncratic volatilities\n","    betas = np.random.uniform(0.6, 1.4, size=n_assets).astype(np.float64)\n","    idio_vol = np.random.uniform(0.008, 0.020, size=n_assets).astype(np.float64)\n","    idio_scale = np.where(regime == 0, 1.0, 1.8).astype(np.float64)\n","\n","    # Generate asset returns\n","    asset_ret = np.zeros((n_days, n_assets), dtype=np.float64)\n","    for a in range(n_assets):\n","        eps = np.random.normal(loc=0.0, scale=idio_vol[a] * idio_scale, size=n_days)\n","        asset_ret[:, a] = betas[a] * mkt_ret + eps\n","\n","    # Generate prices from log returns\n","    log_p0 = np.log(np.random.uniform(20.0, 150.0, size=n_assets))\n","    log_prices = np.zeros((n_days, n_assets), dtype=np.float64)\n","    log_prices[0, :] = log_p0\n","\n","    for t in range(1, n_days):\n","        log_prices[t, :] = log_prices[t-1, :] + asset_ret[t, :]\n","\n","    prices = np.exp(log_prices)\n","\n","    return {\n","        \"regime\": regime,\n","        \"mkt_ret\": mkt_ret,\n","        \"asset_ret\": asset_ret,\n","        \"prices\": prices,\n","        \"betas\": betas,\n","    }\n","\n","\n","market = generate_market(CFG.n_days, CFG.n_assets)\n","print(\"\\nMarket data shapes:\")\n","print(\"-\" * 60)\n","for k, v in market.items():\n","    shape_info = v.shape if hasattr(v, \"shape\") else f\"scalar ({type(v).__name__})\"\n","    print(f\"{k:12s}: {shape_info}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Wb04rB5YzIt9","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1766754916274,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":48,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"5546bdf5-bc17-4fe8-9009-fc41b47117d7"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n","Market data shapes:\n","------------------------------------------------------------\n","regime      : (600,)\n","mkt_ret     : (600,)\n","asset_ret   : (600, 12)\n","prices      : (600, 12)\n","betas       : (12,)\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##4.SYNTHETIC EVENT FEED AND RAW EVENT LOG"],"metadata":{"id":"inQCWDtS0Vh8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###4.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"tIEPgGcK0jjn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Purpose and Multi-Timestamp Architecture**\n","\n","Section 4 generates the core data structure of the event-driven system: a synthetic\n","news feed with sophisticated temporal semantics. Unlike simplified event studies that\n","treat news as instantaneous, this implementation recognizes that real-world information\n","flows through multiple stages before becoming tradable.

This multi-timestamp architecture\n","enforces causality by making explicit the latency between occurrence and tradability.\n","\n","**Event Generation Mechanics**\n","\n","Events are generated through a Poisson process with time-varying intensity. Each\n","asset-day combination has a base event rate of 0.25 events per day, meaning on average\n","each asset experiences one event every four days. However, the system implements event\n","clustering to capture the empirical observation that news arrives in bursts. With 8%\n","probability, any given day becomes a \"cluster day\" where the event rate multiplies\n","by 6x, creating periods of intense information flow that mimic earnings seasons or\n","macro announcement periods.\n","\n","Events are distributed randomly throughout each 24-hour period, with occurrence times\n","drawn uniformly across all minutes of the day.

Premium wire services (WIRE_A\n","at tier 1.0) are more likely to be selected than blogs (BLOG_C at tier 0.5), creating\n","a realistic distribution where higher-quality sources dominate the feed. These tier\n","weights will later influence feature construction, allowing the system to down-weight\n","lower-quality sources appropriately.\n","\n","Event types span six categories: EARNINGS, GUIDANCE, MACRO, LEGAL, RUMOR, and OTHER,\n","each with different selection probabilities. This taxonomy captures the diverse\n","information landscape of financial markets, from scheduled releases (earnings) to\n","unexpected developments (legal issues) to speculative information (rumors).\n","\n","**Sentiment Direction and Regime Interaction**\n","\n","Each event receives a binary sentiment direction (+1 positive, -1 negative) that\n","influences headline generation. Critically, this direction is not purely random but\n","responds to the market's volatility regime. During calm periods (regime 0), 55% of\n","events are positive, reflecting typical market optimism. During stressed periods\n","(regime 1), this flips to 45% positive, capturing how negative news tends to cluster\n","during crises. This creates realistic correlation between market conditions and news\n","sentiment that the trading strategy must navigate.\n","\n","**Headline Generation as Controlled Variation**\n","\n","The make_headline function generates synthetic text that embeds the event type and\n","sentiment direction in natural language. For example, a positive EARNINGS event\n","produces \"Company beats estimates and reports strong growth,\" while a negative one\n","yields \"Company misses estimates and issues weak warning.\" These headlines are\n","deliberately formulaic to ensure the lexicon-based sentiment analyzer from Section 2\n","can reliably extract the intended signal. The text contains specific words from the\n","lexicon (\"beats,\" \"misses,\" \"strong,\" \"weak\") that map directly to numerical sentiment\n","scores.\n","\n","This controlled text generation serves a pedagogical purpose: it allows verification\n","that the entire pipeline (text → tokens → sentiment → features → signals → trades)\n","operates correctly. In production systems, real news text would be unpredictable,\n","but this synthetic approach isolates the event-processing logic from text-parsing\n","uncertainty.\n","\n","**Realistic Time Delays**\n","\n","The temporal realism emerges through three layers of delay. First, publication delay\n","varies uniformly from 0 to 240 minutes (4 hours), modeling how long it takes from\n","event occurrence to public dissemination. Breaking news might publish immediately,\n","while routine filings could lag hours. Second, first_seen_time adds another 0-60\n","minutes for the system's ingestion process to capture the feed. Third, known_time\n","adds a fixed 10-minute processing buffer representing the time needed to parse text,\n","extract features, and prepare data for decision-making.\n","\n","These cascading delays create a realistic gap between when something happens and\n","when it becomes actionable. An event occurring at 10:00 AM might not be published\n","until 12:30 PM, ingested at 1:15 PM, and ready for trading at 1:25 PM—missing the\n","original occurrence by over three hours.

This key design recognizes that the same\n","fundamental news may appear multiple times—a wire service might issue corrections,\n","different sources might report the same earnings beat, or a system might accidentally\n","ingest the same feed twice.\n","\n","The headline normalization process (using the tokenization logic from Section 2)\n","ensures that minor wording variations don't create false duplicates. By truncating\n","to 20 tokens, the system focuses on substantive content while ignoring boilerplate\n","endings. The inclusion of publication day allows the same company to report similar\n","news on different days (quarterly earnings every three months, for instance) without\n","triggering deduplication. The source identifier preserves independent reporting—if\n","WIRE_A and WIRE_B both cover the same earnings beat, these are treated as distinct\n","events because different sources provide independent confirmation.\n","\n","**Schema Versioning for Evolution**\n","\n","Each ledger entry includes a schema_version field (CH15_LEDGER_v1) that makes the\n","data structure's contract explicit. This versioning strategy anticipates evolution:\n","future iterations might add fields for entity extraction confidence, regulatory\n","classification flags, or multi-language support. When schema changes occur, the\n","version field allows downstream code to handle both old and new formats gracefully,\n","or reject incompatible versions with clear error messages.\n","\n","The ledger schema includes all four temporal fields from the raw events plus an\n","instrument_confidence score (set to 1.0 in this synthetic environment). In production\n","systems, this confidence would reflect the entity resolution process—how certain\n","the system is that \"the company\" in the headline maps to the claimed asset_id. By\n","including this field even when unused, the schema acknowledges real-world complexity\n","and provides a placeholder for future enhancement.\n","\n","**Monotonic Time Validation**\n","\n","Before accepting the ledger, the system runs monotonic_time_tests to verify temporal\n","consistency: event_time ≤ published_time ≤ first_seen_time ≤ known_time. This\n","inequality must hold for every event—information cannot be published before it\n","occurs, cannot be seen before publication, and cannot be processed before observation.\n","The test returns a violation count and status (PASS/FAIL), making data quality\n","explicit rather than assumed.\n","\n","This validation catches corrupted timestamps, timezone conversion errors, or logic\n","bugs in the event generator. The assertion that violations equal zero enforces a\n","hard constraint: the notebook halts if temporal ordering is violated, preventing\n","contaminated data from propagating into features and signals. This fail-fast approach\n","embodies defensive programming—better to stop immediately than produce invalid results.\n","\n","**As-Of Snapshot Infrastructure**\n","\n","The as-of snapshot mechanism addresses a critical operational question: what did\n","the system know at time T? By creating monthly snapshots that include only events\n","where known_time ≤ snapshot_time, the system can reconstruct the exact information\n","state at any historical moment. This capability is essential for production debugging\n","(why did the system trade on day X?) and research validation (did this feature exist\n","in the live system when we claim it did?).\n","\n","Each snapshot is self-contained: it specifies the snapshot time, included sources,\n","backfill policy (\"append-only; as-of known_time\"), schema version, event count, and\n","the full ledger hash for lineage tracking. The snapshot itself receives a\n","cryptographic hash, creating a tamper-evident seal. The manifest aggregates these\n","snapshot metadata records, providing a high-level index of what information was\n","available when.\n","\n","**Governance Through Append-Only Lineage**\n","\n","The snapshot design implements an append-only philosophy: old snapshots never change,\n","new snapshots only add events that have since become known. This immutability means\n","the system can prove it never retroactively altered historical knowledge.

This section bridges the gap between semantic content\n","(headlines with sentiment) and numerical representations that aggregation functions\n","can process. The feature extraction philosophy prioritizes transparency and causality:\n","every derived number must be explainable in terms of its constituent events, and no\n","feature can incorporate information from the future. The section computes four\n","event-level features—document sentiment, token count, novelty, and source weight—that\n","will later be aggregated across time windows to produce trading signals.\n","\n","**Document Sentiment Extraction**\n","\n","The first feature applies the lexicon-based sentiment analyzer from Section 2 to\n","each event's headline. This produces a numerical score where positive values indicate\n","optimistic news (earnings beats, guidance raises) and negative values signal pessimism\n","(lawsuits, downgrades). The sentiment score inherits all the linguistic sophistication\n","built into the lexicon: negation handling, intensifier modulation, phrase detection,\n","and length normalization. By computing sentiment at ingestion time and storing it\n","as a feature, the system separates text processing (slow, complex) from numerical\n","aggregation (fast, simple), enabling efficient repeated experimentation with different\n","aggregation windows without re-parsing text.\n","\n","**Token Count as Signal Quality**\n","\n","The token_count feature records headline length measured in tokens. While seemingly\n","mundane, this metric serves as a proxy for information content and source quality.\n","Substantive news releases tend to be longer than brief rumors or alerts. Later\n","analyses could weight longer documents more heavily, or use token count to detect\n","anomalous events (unusually terse earnings announcements might signal limited\n","disclosure). The feature also enables length-based filtering: excluding very short\n","headlines that lack context or very long ones that might be aggregated news digests\n","rather than focused reports.\n","\n","**Novelty Detection Through Rolling Windows**\n","\n","The novelty feature implements a sophisticated information-theoretic concept: has\n","this headline already been seen recently? The system maintains per-asset rolling\n","windows of normalized headlines spanning the past 10 days (configurable via\n","novelty_window_days). When a new event arrives, the system checks whether its\n","normalized headline matches any headline in that asset's recent history. If it's\n","genuinely new, novelty equals 1.0; if it's a duplicate or near-duplicate, novelty\n","equals 0.0.\n","\n","This binary novelty signal captures the intuition that market-moving information\n","tends to be surprising. The third earnings beat in a week might matter less than\n","the first. A company repeatedly mentioned in legal news might see diminished price\n","reaction to yet another lawsuit filing. By tracking novelty, the system can\n","down-weight redundant information that markets have likely already incorporated.\n","\n","The implementation carefully maintains causality: the novelty check only examines\n","events with known_time strictly before the current event's known_time. An event\n","cannot retroactively become less novel because future information arrived. The\n","normalized headline comparison uses the same 20-token truncation as deduplication\n","keys, ensuring consistency across the system and focusing on substantive content\n","rather than stylistic variation.\n","\n","**Source Weight for Quality Discrimination**\n","\n","The source_weight feature maps each event's source identifier to a tier value defined\n","in Section 4. Premium wire services receive weight 1.0, while blogs receive 0.5,\n","creating a 2:1 quality ratio. This weighting acknowledges that not all news sources\n","are equally reliable or market-moving. Institutional investors trust verified wire\n","services more than unverified blogs, and price reactions typically confirm this\n","hierarchy.\n","\n","By encoding source quality as a numerical feature rather than hard filtering, the\n","system maintains flexibility. Lower-tier sources aren't excluded—they contribute to\n","signals but with appropriately reduced influence. This design also creates an explicit\n","parameter (the tier weights) that can be calibrated against empirical data: do blog\n","posts actually deserve 0.5x weighting, or should it be 0.3x or 0.7x? The feature\n","structure makes such questions answerable through systematic experimentation.\n","\n","**Feature Specification Registry for Reproducibility**\n","\n","The enrichment process concludes by generating a comprehensive feature_spec_registry\n","artifact that documents every design choice. This registry records tokenization rules\n","(lowercase, phrase injection), lexicon parameters (negation window, intensifier boost,\n","clipping thresholds), and aggregation parameters (decay half-lives, window lengths).\n","The registry receives its own cryptographic hash, creating tamper-evident documentation\n","of the feature generation process.\n","\n","This registry serves multiple purposes. For reproducibility, it allows future\n","researchers to reconstruct the exact feature extraction logic. For debugging, it\n","provides the ground truth specification when features behave unexpectedly. For\n","compliance, it documents the methodology in human-readable form suitable for\n","regulatory review. The registry exemplifies governance-native design: the system\n","doesn't just compute features, it creates a permanent record of how and why those\n","features were computed, ensuring that the methodology survives personnel changes and\n","organizational evolution."],"metadata":{"id":"g4vftfPk3dLq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"v7jIIy1q3dfl"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Feature extraction from events (text -> numbers) + novelty\n","\n","\n","def days_between(later: datetime, earlier: datetime) -> float:\n","    \"\"\"Calculate days between two datetimes.\"\"\"\n","    return (later -

While Section 6 enriched individual events\n","with numerical attributes, trading strategies require aggregated views: how much\n","positive sentiment has accumulated recently?

This section constructs a daily decision grid aligned with market\n","close (21:00 UTC) and aggregates event features backward in time from each decision\n","point, strictly enforcing that no future information contaminates any decision.\n","\n","**Decision Grid Construction**\n","\n","The decision grid establishes when trading decisions can be made. Rather than assuming\n","instantaneous reaction to every event, the system implements a realistic daily\n","decision cadence where positions are evaluated once per day at a fixed time—conceptually\n","representing end-of-day portfolio review. The 21:00 UTC timing approximates US market\n","close, though the exact hour matters less than consistency: every decision uses the\n","same temporal reference point.\n","\n","This daily grid creates 600 decision opportunities across the 600-day sample period.\n","Each decision point represents a moment when the portfolio manager could adjust\n","positions based on accumulated information. The grid structure separates decision\n","frequency (daily) from event arrival frequency (continuous throughout each day),\n","reflecting how institutional trading actually works—information arrives continuously,\n","but portfolio adjustments happen at discrete intervals constrained by operational\n","capacity and transaction costs.\n","\n","**The Causality Enforcement Mechanism**\n","\n","The core governance constraint appears in aggregate_features_at_time: for any event\n","to contribute to a decision at time T, that event's known_time must be strictly less\n","than or equal to T. This implements the fundamental causality requirement—decisions\n","can only use information that existed when the decision was made. The system computes\n","age_days as the temporal distance between decision time and known time, and raises\n","a RuntimeError if this age is negative, which would indicate a logic error allowing\n","future information to leak backward.\n","\n","This enforcement is non-negotiable and operates at the lowest level of feature\n","construction. Unlike soft filters that could be accidentally bypassed, the causality\n","check is hardcoded into the aggregation function itself. Every feature value at every\n","decision point results from iterating through events and explicitly verifying temporal\n","admissibility before accumulation.\n","\n","**Four Aggregation Features with Different Time Semantics**\n","\n","The system constructs four aggregated features, each capturing different temporal\n","dynamics. **Count_W** tallies events in a fixed 3-day window, implementing a simple\n","recent-activity metric. If 8 events occurred in the past 3 days, count_W equals 8.0.\n","This feature has a hard boundary: events from 4 days ago contribute zero, creating\n","discrete jumps as events age beyond the window edge.\n","\n","**Novelty_count_W** applies the same 3-day window but weights each event by its\n","novelty score. If 5 of those 8 recent events were novel and 3 were duplicates,\n","novelty_count_W equals 5.0. This metric isolates genuinely new information flow,\n","filtering out repetitive coverage of known developments.\n","\n","**Dec_sent** (decayed sentiment) implements exponential decay without a hard window\n","boundary. Each event's sentiment is weighted by exp(-λ × age), where λ derives from\n","the configured 2-day half-life. An event from yesterday receives nearly full weight,\n","one from 2 days ago receives 0.5× weight, one from 4 days ago receives 0.25× weight,\n","and so on, asymptotically approaching zero for very old events. This smooth decay\n","reflects the intuition that sentiment influence fades gradually rather than\n","disappearing abruptly at a window boundary.\n","\n","**Dec_src_sent** (decayed source-weighted sentiment) multiplies each event's sentiment\n","by both its decay weight and its source quality weight before accumulation. A recent\n","positive headline from WIRE_A (tier 1.0) contributes more than a week-old positive\n","headline from BLOG_C (tier 0.5), correctly prioritizing both recency and reliability.\n","\n","\n","**Feature Matrix Structure and Provenance Sampling**\n","\n","The aggregation produces a three-dimensional feature matrix F with shape [600 days,\n","12 assets, 4 features]. Each cell F[t, a, f] represents the value of feature f for\n","asset a at decision time t, computed using only events known at that moment. This\n","tensor structure separates temporal, cross-sectional, and feature dimensions cleanly,\n","enabling efficient vectorized operations in later backtesting.\n","\n","For governance, the system samples provenance at selected decision points (days 50,\n","120, 250, 400, 520), recording which event IDs were admissible and what feature\n","values resulted. This creates an audit trail: if feature values look suspicious,\n","investigators can examine the specific events that contributed and verify the\n","aggregation logic.

While previous sections built\n","the information infrastructure, this section implements the actual trading logic:\n","when to buy, when to sell, how much capital to deploy, and how to measure outcomes.\n","The strategy deliberately prioritizes simplicity and interpretability over complexity—\n","using transparent rules that can be explained to skeptical risk managers rather than\n","opaque optimization that might overfit synthetic data.\n","\n","**Base Signal Construction from Sentiment Flow**\n","\n","The primary signal derives from dec_src_sent, the source-weighted decayed sentiment\n","aggregation. This choice reflects a core hypothesis: recent high-quality positive\n","sentiment predicts positive returns, while recent high-quality negative sentiment\n","predicts negative returns. The exponential decay ensures that yesterday's news\n","matters more than last week's, and the source weighting ensures that verified wire\n","reports matter more than unverified blogs. The signal is continuous—stronger sentiment\n","creates stronger conviction—but position sizing will discretize this into practical\n","allocations.\n","\n","**Thresholding and Direction Assignment**\n","\n","Rather than trading on every tiny sentiment fluctuation, the system applies a\n","threshold of 0.35: only when absolute sentiment exceeds this level does the signal\n","become actionable. This creates a dead zone around zero where the system remains\n","neutral, avoiding excessive trading on noise. When sentiment exceeds the threshold\n","positively, direction equals +1 (long position). When sentiment exceeds the threshold\n","negatively, direction equals -1 (short position). This binary directionality simplifies\n","position management and prevents fractional signals from creating unintended leverage.\n","**Hazard-Based Throttling for Event Clustering**\n","\n","The throttle mechanism addresses a subtle risk: excessive event clustering might\n","indicate information overload rather than genuine insight. When count_W (the 3-day\n","event count) exceeds 6 events, the system applies a throttle_factor of 0.3, reducing\n","position size to 30% of the original signal. This defensive rule recognizes that\n","periods of intense news flow often coincide with elevated uncertainty—markets become\n","noisy, contradictory information proliferates, and the signal-to-noise ratio degrades.\n","By throttling during such periods, the strategy reduces exposure precisely when\n","confidence should be lowest.\n","\n","**Position Holding and Turnover Management**\n","\n","The holding period implements temporal smoothing: once a position is established,\n","it persists for 2 days (hold_days parameter) unless a new signal overrides it. This\n","reduces turnover and reflects practical trading constraints—constantly adjusting\n","positions incurs transaction costs and operational overhead. The holding logic tracks\n","remaining hold time per asset: when a new signal arrives, the hold counter resets to\n","2; otherwise it decrements daily until reaching zero, at which point the position\n","reverts to neutral if no new signal has emerged.\n","\n","This approach balances responsiveness with stability. The system can react to breaking\n","news by immediately establishing a new position, but it won't whipsaw in and out of\n","trades on every daily sentiment fluctuation. The 2-day horizon aligns with the\n","2-day sentiment decay half-life, creating conceptual consistency: information that\n","decays over 2 days should inform positions held for roughly 2 days.\n","\n","**Gross Exposure Normalization**\n","\n","The position normalization step ensures that total portfolio risk remains bounded.\n","Each day, the system computes gross exposure (sum of absolute position weights across\n","all assets). If this exceeds max_gross_exposure (1.0), positions are scaled down\n","proportionally so that total exposure equals exactly 1.0. This creates equal-weighted\n","deployment across active signals: if 4 assets have signals, each receives 25% weight;\n","if 10 assets have signals, each receives 10% weight. The normalization prevents\n","leverage accumulation when many signals activate simultaneously.\n","\n","**Execution Delay and Return Attribution**\n","\n","The backtest implements realistic execution mechanics through execution_delay_days\n","(1 day). A position decided at close of day t is executed at close of day t+1, and\n","earns the return from day t+1 to day t+2. This lag models operational reality:\n","end-of-day decisions trigger orders that execute the following day, and those\n","positions earn returns over the subsequent day. The delay prevents the look-ahead\n","bias inherent in assuming instantaneous execution at decision prices.\n","\n","Return attribution follows standard portfolio accounting: daily PnL equals the dot\n","product of position weights and realized returns. The system sums across all assets\n","to produce a scalar PnL for each day, creating a time series of 600 daily returns\n","that characterizes strategy performance.\n","\n","**Performance Metrics and Sharpe Ratio**\n","\n","The metrics calculation computes mean daily return, daily standard deviation, and\n","annualized Sharpe ratio—the risk-adjusted return measure standard in quantitative\n","finance. The Sharpe calculation assumes 252 trading days per year, scaling daily\n","statistics to annualized equivalents. Average turnover measures position churn by\n","averaging the L1 norm of daily position changes, providing insight into trading\n","intensity and implied transaction costs.\n","\n","**Decision Trace for Auditability**\n","\n","The decision_trace artifact samples specific trading days (60-62, 200-202, 420-422)\n","and records the complete decision context: feature values, signal computation,\n","throttle application, position weight, execution timing, and realized return. This\n","creates a detailed audit trail showing exactly how specific trades originated and\n","performed, enabling post-mortem analysis when actual results deviate from expectations.\n","\n","The equity curve visualization plots cumulative log PnL, providing intuitive feedback\n","on strategy behavior—sustained uptrends indicate consistent edge, flat periods suggest\n","no signal, drawdowns reveal when the strategy struggled.

portfolio backtesting to micro-level diagnostics through event\n","study analysis. While Section 8 evaluated aggregate strategy performance, this section\n","asks a more granular question: what happens to individual asset prices after specific\n","types of news events? By aligning events to the decision timeline and tracking\n","subsequent returns, the analysis measures whether the sentiment extraction and feature\n","construction processes actually correlate with real price movements. This diagnostic\n","layer validates the core hypothesis underlying the trading strategy: that positive\n","sentiment events predict positive returns and negative sentiment events predict\n","negative returns.\n","\n","**Decision-Time Alignment for Causality**\n","\n","The crucial mapping function (map_event_to_decision_index) translates event timestamps\n","into decision indices by finding the first decision time greater than or equal to\n","the event's known_time. This alignment ensures temporal consistency: an event known\n","at 14:30 maps to the 21:00 decision that same day, while an event known at 22:00\n","maps to the next day's 21:00 decision. The mapping respects causality—events are\n","paired with the earliest decision point where they could possibly influence trading.\n","\n","This decision-alignment framework differs from traditional event studies that measure\n","returns from exact event timestamps. Such naive approaches ignore practical trading\n","constraints: even if news breaks at 14:30, actual portfolio adjustments might not\n","occur until end-of-day rebalancing. By aligning to the decision grid, the analysis\n","measures tradable returns—what a realistic trading system could actually capture—\n","rather than theoretical returns available only to instantaneous traders.\n","\n","**Strong Event Selection and Sentiment Stratification**\n","\n","The analysis focuses on events where absolute sentiment exceeds the trading threshold\n","(0.35), filtering to \"strong sentiment events\" that actually trigger signals. This\n","selection creates a fair comparison: the event study examines the same events that\n","the trading strategy acts upon, eliminating weak signals that contribute noise without\n","driving decisions. The strong event set is then partitioned into positive-sentiment\n","and negative-sentiment subgroups, enabling separate return curves that should exhibit\n","opposite directional patterns if sentiment truly predicts returns.\n","\n","**Cumulative Return Curves Over Horizons**\n","\n","For each event, the system computes cumulative returns from the aligned decision\n","point forward across a 25-day horizon. The cumulative structure reveals how returns\n","evolve: do prices react immediately and plateau, or does impact accumulate gradually?\n","The averaging across all events in each sentiment category (positive or negative)\n","produces expected return trajectories that smooth over idiosyncratic noise.\n","\n","The dual curves (positive events vs. negative events) create a visual diagnostic.\n","If sentiment extraction works correctly, the positive curve should trend upward\n","(positive events predict price increases) while the negative curve should trend\n","downward or remain flat (negative events predict price decreases or zero returns).\n","Curve separation measures signal strength—wider divergence indicates stronger\n","predictive power. Convergence or crossover would suggest sentiment extraction failure\n","or that markets don't respond to the measured sentiment dimension.\n","\n","**Half-Life Estimation as Operational Metric**\n","\n","The half-life calculation addresses a practical question: how long does event impact\n","persist? The metric identifies when cumulative return reaches 50% of its long-horizon\n","value, measuring the timescale over which information gets incorporated into prices.\n","A half-life of 2 days suggests rapid price adjustment, while 10 days indicates slow\n","diffusion. This operational measure informs strategy design: if impact half-life is\n","2 days, the 2-day position holding period aligns correctly; if half-life were 10 days,\n","the holding period should be extended to capture more of the price adjustment process.\n","\n","The implementation handles both positive and negative curves correctly: for positive\n","curves, it finds when cumulative return exceeds half the final value; for negative\n","curves, it finds when cumulative return falls below half the final value. The\n","directionality adjustment ensures the metric measures time-to-halfway regardless of\n","return sign.\n","\n","**Statistical Robustness Through Aggregation**\n","\n","The event study aggregates across hundreds of events (all strong-sentiment occurrences\n","in the 600-day sample), providing statistical power that individual event analysis\n","lacks. Idiosyncratic noise from specific companies or days gets averaged away,\n","revealing systematic patterns. The count arrays track how many events contribute to\n","each horizon lag, allowing assessment of statistical reliability—early lags include\n","all events, but later lags might have fewer observations as some events occur too\n","close to sample end to observe full horizons.\n","\n","**Diagnostic Interpretation and Strategy Validation**\n","\n","The event study serves as an independent validation of the trading strategy. If the\n","backtest shows positive Sharpe ratio but event studies show no systematic return\n","patterns after strong-sentiment events, something is wrong—either the backtest has\n","look-ahead bias, or the strategy is capturing beta rather than sentiment-driven\n","alpha. Conversely, if event studies confirm that positive sentiment events lead to\n","positive cumulative returns with appropriate half-lives, this validates the fundamental\n","assumption underlying the strategy.\n","\n","The visualization provides immediate intuitive feedback. Diverging curves with the\n","expected directional signs (positive curve ascending, negative curve descending)\n","confirm that lexicon-based sentiment extraction captures market-relevant information.\n","The half-life estimates quantify the temporal scale of price adjustment, connecting\n","empirical evidence to strategy design choices like holding periods and decay parameters.\n","This diagnostic layer transforms the strategy from a black-box return generator into\n","an explainable system where each component's contribution can be verified through\n","independent measurement."],"metadata":{"id":"8OvKZaVn6j3n"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###9.2.CODE AND

Testing**\n","\n","Section 10 implements rigorous placebo tests that address a fundamental question:\n","does the observed strategy performance derive from genuine predictive content, or\n","could it arise from spurious patterns in the synthetic data? Placebo testing applies\n","the scientific method's core principle—comparing actual results against carefully\n","constructed null hypotheses where the signal should disappear. By deliberately\n","destroying specific information channels through randomization while preserving\n","others, these tests isolate which aspects of the data actually drive performance,\n","providing evidence that performance isn't merely data-mining artifact.\n","\n","**The Timestamp Placebo: Destroying Temporal Information**\n","\n","The timestamp placebo test asks: does timing matter? It shuffles known_time values\n","within temporal buckets (30-day periods) and asset groups while keeping headline\n","text fixed. This randomization preserves the distribution of sentiment words and\n","event types but destroys the temporal relationship between when events occurred and\n","when returns moved. If the strategy's edge derives from timing—reacting to breaking\n","news before markets fully adjust—this randomization should eliminate performance.\n","Conversely, if performance persists under timestamp shuffling, timing isn't the\n","critical factor.\n","\n","The bucketing approach (30-day windows) maintains realistic event density and seasonal\n","patterns while randomizing fine-grained timing. An event that originally occurred on\n","day 45 might be reassigned to day 55, but won't jump to day 200. This localized\n","shuffling creates a conservative test: it destroys short-term timing relationships\n","that trading strategies exploit while preserving longer-term market regime structure.\n","\n","After shuffling, the system re-enriches events to maintain pipeline consistency.\n","Novelty scores must be recomputed because the temporal order changed—an event that\n","was novel in the original sequence might not be novel in the shuffled sequence. This\n","re-enrichment ensures the placebo uses the same feature construction logic as the\n","base case, isolating the timestamp effect from implementation artifacts.\n","\n","**The Text Shuffle Placebo: Destroying Content Information**\n","\n","The text shuffle placebo inverts the timestamp test: it randomizes headline content\n","while preserving known_time timestamps. Headlines are shuffled within buckets defined\n","by time period and source tier, maintaining the distribution of content quality and\n","temporal event flow while destroying the link between specific text and specific\n","moments. If the strategy's edge derives from sentiment content—identifying genuinely\n","positive or negative news—this randomization should eliminate performance. If\n","performance persists, then mere event occurrence (regardless of content) might be\n","the driver.\n","\n","The source-tier grouping ensures that high-quality wire headlines don't randomly\n","migrate to low-quality blog sources, preserving the realistic distribution of content\n","quality across source types. A positive earnings beat from WIRE_A might be swapped\n","with a negative lawsuit headline from WIRE_A, but won't be confused with a blog post\n","from BLOG_C.\n","\n","The re-enrichment process after text shuffling recomputes sentiment scores and\n","deduplication keys based on the new headlines.

While placebo tests\n","validate that signals contain genuine information, robustness tests address overfitting\n","concerns: did the strategy merely memorize patterns specific to this particular\n","synthetic dataset, or does it capture generalizable relationships that persist across\n","different subsets and conditions? These tests simulate the transition from research\n","to production, where strategies encounter market regimes and data sources they've\n","never seen before.\n","\n","**Time-Based Split: Temporal Out-of-Sample Testing**\n","\n","The time split divides the 600-day sample into training (first 70%, approximately\n","420 days) and testing (final 30%, approximately 180 days) periods. This chronological\n","split mimics realistic deployment: strategies are developed on historical data, then\n","evaluated on subsequent unseen data. The temporal ordering is critical—using the\n","first 70% as training and last 30% as testing prevents look-ahead bias, while the\n","reverse split would contaminate training with future information.\n","\n","The split fraction (0.7) balances competing objectives. Larger training sets provide\n","more data for pattern detection but leave less for out-of-sample validation. Smaller\n","training sets create more stringent tests but might not provide sufficient data to\n","establish reliable patterns. The 70/30 split represents conventional practice in\n","quantitative finance, offering reasonable compromise between these tensions.\n","\n","Critically, this test uses the full feature matrix and backtest output without\n","retraining. The strategy doesn't \"learn\" from the training period—all parameters\n","(sentiment threshold, decay half-life, holding period) were specified in the\n","configuration before seeing any data. The split merely evaluates whether performance\n","metrics computed on the training subset remain consistent with metrics on the testing\n","subset. Substantial performance degradation in the test period would suggest the\n","synthetic data contains regime changes or that the 600-day sample is too short to\n","produce stable estimates.\n","\n","**Source-Based Split: Systematic Sensitivity Analysis**\n","\n","The source split tests run four parallel backtests, each excluding events from one\n","of the four news sources (WIRE_A, WIRE_B, BLOG_C, AGG_D). This ablation study\n","reveals source dependencies: if dropping WIRE_A collapses performance but dropping\n","BLOG_C barely affects results, the strategy relies primarily on premium wire content.\n","Such findings inform production deployment—the system should prioritize maintaining\n","WIRE_A connectivity and could tolerate BLOG_C outages without severe degradation.\n","\n","The source split also stress-tests the aggregation logic. With one source removed,\n","event counts decrease and sentiment aggregations change. If the strategy is robust,\n","it should adapt gracefully to reduced information flow, producing lower magnitude\n","signals but maintaining directional accuracy. Catastrophic failure (negative Sharpe\n","after source removal) would indicate dangerous concentration risk—the strategy works\n","only when all sources contribute, making it fragile to real-world data feed disruptions.\n","\n","Each source removal creates a filtered event set, which then undergoes complete\n","feature matrix reconstruction and backtesting. This ensures that the test evaluates\n","the full pipeline under degraded data conditions rather than merely recalculating\n","metrics on cached features. The feature aggregations correctly reflect reduced event\n","counts and altered sentiment distributions that result from source removal.\n","\n","**Metrics on Slices: Consistent Performance Measurement**\n","\n","The metrics_on_slice function computes identical performance statistics (mean daily\n","return, standard deviation, Sharpe ratio) on both full-sample and split-sample data.\n","This consistency enables direct comparison: training Sharpe of 1.2 versus test Sharpe\n","of 0.8 indicates some performance degradation but suggests the strategy retains\n","meaningful signal. Training Sharpe of 1.2 versus test Sharpe of -0.3 would indicate\n","severe overfitting or regime change.\n","\n","The function operates on PnL time series from the original backtest, slicing by\n","index rather than recomputing returns. This approach ensures that any discrepancies\n","between training and testing reflect genuine sample variation rather than computational\n","artifacts. The annualization factor (sqrt(252)) applies consistently to both periods,\n","maintaining comparability.\n","\n","**Interpreting Robustness Results**\n","\n","Ideal robustness results show modest, explainable variation across splits. Test\n","period Sharpe slightly below training Sharpe suggests normal statistical fluctuation—\n","smaller samples produce noisier estimates. Test Sharpe significantly above training\n","Sharpe might indicate the strategy performs better in certain market regimes (perhaps\n","the test period had more volatile conditions where event-driven strategies excel).\n","\n","For source splits, relatively similar Sharpe ratios across all four single-source\n","removals indicate balanced source utilization—no single source dominates strategy\n","performance. Highly asymmetric results (dropping WIRE_A crashes Sharpe while dropping\n","others barely affects it) reveal concentration risk that should inform infrastructure\n","investment: the system needs redundant WIRE_A feeds but can tolerate lower reliability\n","from secondary sources.\n","\n","**Governance Through Comprehensive Logging**\n","\n","The robustness_suite_log artifact preserves complete results: training and test\n","metrics from the time split, plus full backtest metrics from all four source removal\n","scenarios. This comprehensive record enables post-hoc analysis—reviewers can examine\n","whether observed production performance falls within the range demonstrated by\n","robustness tests, or whether production has encountered conditions outside the tested\n","regime.\n","\n","The logged results also support meta-analysis across multiple strategy iterations.\n","If version 1 shows 20% Sharpe degradation from training to testing while version 2\n","shows 5% degradation, version 2 likely generalizes better even if both show similar\n","training performance. The artifact structure—time split and source split as separate\n","top-level keys—makes such comparisons programmatically accessible rather than requiring\n","manual log parsing.\n","\n","These robustness tests complete the validation pyramid: placebos confirm signals\n","contain information, time splits confirm temporal stability, and source splits confirm\n","structural robustness.

The report notes\n","that this synthetic environment handles session boundaries through the known_time\n","mapping mechanism, which consolidates complex real-world timing into discrete decision\n","points. This documentation serves as placeholder for production systems where session\n","boundary handling becomes critical (should after-hours earnings releases be tradable\n","at next-day open or current-day close?).\n","\n","**Pre-Event Drift Diagnostics for Information Leakage Detection**\n","\n","The pre-event drift analysis investigates whether asset prices move in the expected\n","direction before events become known—a pattern that would indicate either information\n","leakage (the event was known earlier than claimed) or look-ahead bias (the system\n","incorrectly used future information). The analysis focuses on unscheduled event types\n","(LEGAL, RUMOR, OTHER) because scheduled events like earnings announcements naturally\n","show pre-announcement drift as markets anticipate results.\n","\n","For each unscheduled event type, the system computes average cumulative returns over\n","the three days preceding the event's first tradable decision point (lags -3, -2, -1).\n","If legal events in the sample show positive average pre-event returns, this might\n","suggest that positive legal developments were leaked before official announcement,\n","or that the event generation process inadvertently created correlation between\n","preceding returns and event occurrence. Large pre-event drift in either direction\n","warrants investigation.\n","\n","The analysis carefully respects causality boundaries: it only examines returns on\n","days before the decision-aligned event, using the map_event_to_decision_index function\n","to ensure temporal consistency. An event with known_time at 14:00 on day 100 maps to\n","the 21:00 decision on day 100, so pre-event returns are measured on days 97, 98, 99—\n","genuinely prior to when the event could influence trading.\n","\n","**Statistical Summary and Interpretation Guidance**\n","\n","For each event type, the report calculates sample size, mean pre-event return, and\n","standard deviation. These statistics enable interpretation: mean close to zero with\n","high standard deviation suggests no systematic pre-event drift, just normal return\n","volatility. Mean significantly different from zero (relative to standard error =\n","std/sqrt(n)) would indicate potential issues requiring investigation.\n","\n","The synthetic environment should show near-zero pre-event drift because event\n","generation is independent of prior returns—the event occurrence probability and\n","sentiment direction depend only on current regime, not on whether the asset recently\n","gained or lost value. Finding substantial drift would reveal a bug in the synthetic\n","data generation process rather than genuine market behavior.\n","\n","**Governance Through Immutable Documentation**\n","\n","The causality_test_report artifact receives its own cryptographic hash and timestamp,\n","creating tamper-evident documentation that these validation tests were performed and\n","passed (or failed).

Unlike\n","traditional research notebooks where outputs exist as disconnected files with informal\n","relationships, this registry creates an explicit dependency graph where each artifact's\n","lineage and integrity can be independently verified through cryptographic hashes.\n","\n","**Registry Architecture and Metadata Structure**\n","\n","The artifact registry follows a hierarchical information architecture. Top-level\n","metadata includes run identification (run_name, run_time_utc), determinism proof\n","(seed), and configuration integrity (config_hash). These fields establish the\n","execution context—when this analysis ran, under what random seed, with which\n","parameter configuration. The config_hash creates cryptographic linkage to the frozen\n","Config dataclass, ensuring that any parameter change would produce a different hash\n","and thus be immediately detectable.\n","\n","The artifacts array catalogs all generated outputs with four fields per artifact:\n","human-readable name, filesystem path, content hash (SHA-256), and implicit type\n","(determined by file extension).

The asof_snapshot_manifest provides monthly point-in-time reconstructions\n","of knowledge state. The feature_spec_registry documents the complete methodology for\n","extracting numerical features from events.\n","\n","Mid-pipeline artifacts include the feature_dump_npz (the aggregated feature matrix\n","in compressed NumPy format) and feature_provenance_samples (examples showing which\n","events contributed to which feature values). Late-pipeline artifacts include\n","decision_trace_sample (showing how features translated into trading signals and\n","realized returns), placebo_suite_results (validation test outcomes), robustness_suite_log\n","(generalization test outcomes), and causality_test_report (temporal integrity\n","verification).\n","\n","This comprehensive coverage ensures that every major transformation—from raw events\n","to ledger, from ledger to features, from features to signals, from signals to\n","returns—has corresponding documentation that can be independently audited.\n","\n","**Primary Metrics as Performance Summary**\n","\n","The registry includes primary_metrics extracted directly from the backtest output\n","(Section 8).

By embedding these metrics in the\n","manifest alongside artifact hashes, the registry creates explicit linkage: these\n","performance numbers derive from these specific artifacts computed under this specific\n","configuration.\n","\n","This linkage prevents metric cherry-picking. The manifest is generated programmatically\n","at notebook completion, so the metrics can't be selectively reported—whatever the\n","backtest produced gets recorded. If subsequent analysis reveals issues requiring\n","rerun, the new manifest will have different artifact hashes and potentially different\n","metrics, creating clear version history rather than silent revision.\n","\n","**Cryptographic Integrity Chain**\n","\n","Each artifact received its own hash when created (raw_hash, ledger_hash, etc.), and\n","now the complete manifest receives its own hash (manifest_hash). This creates a\n","two-level integrity structure: individual artifact hashes prove those files haven't\n","been modified, while the manifest hash proves the collection of artifacts and their\n","relationships haven't changed.

This\n","reproducibility transforms the notebook from a one-time analysis into a reproducible\n","computational experiment that can be verified by independent parties.\n","\n","**Governance Philosophy: Transparency Over Obscurity**\n","\n","The registry embodies a governance philosophy that prioritizes transparency over\n","obscurity. Rather than treating the analytical process as proprietary black-box,\n","this approach documents every step in auditable form. The feature_spec_registry\n","explains exactly how sentiment is computed. The decision_trace shows exactly which\n","events triggered which trades. The causality_report proves temporal discipline was\n","maintained. The placebo and robustness results demonstrate that performance isn't\n","spurious.\n","\n","This transparency serves multiple stakeholders. Regulators can verify that the system\n","doesn't use prohibited information or violate market rules. Risk managers can assess\n","whether the strategy might fail under conditions not represented in the test data.\n","Developers can debug issues by tracing from unexpected outputs back through the\n","dependency chain to identify where assumptions diverged from reality.\n","\n","**Production Deployment Bridge**\n","\n","The final manifest serves as the handoff document from research to production. The\n","artifact hashes prove that the tested system matches the deployed system—if production\n","uses different feature extraction logic or different aggregation windows, the feature\n","matrix hash will differ, immediately flagging the discrepancy. The config hash\n","similarly ensures that production parameters match research parameters, preventing\n","silent drift where seemingly minor changes accumulate into major behavioral differences.\n","\n","The timestamp (run_time_utc) documents when this research was completed, creating\n","temporal ordering for version history.

The entire pipeline you built here is designed to prevent that specific mistake: confusing a clean-looking equity curve with a tradable edge.\n","\n","Practically, you now have a blueprint for turning messy event streams into something a trading system can actually use. You created an immutable ingestion log, standardized it into a canonical event ledger, and made timestamps explicit in a way that forces you to answer the only question that matters: **what did the strategy know, and when did it know it?** That “known-at” concept is not paperwork. It is the boundary between research and self-deception.\n","\n","You also learned why transparency beats sophistication early on. Instead of jumping straight to black-box NLP, you used simple, interpretable text-to-number features. That approach has a real advantage in finance: when things break (and they will), you can debug the system. You can inspect the events that drove a feature, see the feature values that drove a signal, and see the signal that drove a position. That decision trace is the difference between “we think it worked” and “we can prove why it traded.”\n","\n","The diagnostics you ran should shape how you think about “sentiment.” Event studies weren’t treated as academic decoration; they were used as a reality check on timing. If the impact decays too quickly, the strategy is not a signal problem—it’s an execution problem. That’s not a disappointment; it’s clarity. It tells you where the work belongs next (execution and microstructure) and prevents you from spending months tuning a model for an edge that vanishes the moment you add realistic delays.\n","\n","The placebo tests are the other major takeaway. In event-driven research, you should assume that **most impressive results are fragile until they survive adversarial tests.** Shuffling timestamps and shuffling text are simple but powerful ways to test what your system is actually exploiting. If performance survives the wrong shuffle, you are not trading meaning—you’re trading structure, coverage, or leakage. Placebos don’t just protect you from errors; they protect you from stories that feel true.\n","\n","Finally, the governance artifacts you produced—the ledger, the snapshot manifest, the feature dump, the decision trace sample, the robustness logs, and the run manifest—are not “extra.” They are the output of serious research. In an institutional setting, those artifacts are how strategies get reviewed, debated, improved, and ultimately trusted. They are also how you make progress: when performance changes, you can locate the cause instead of guessing.\n","\n","Where this leaves you is a mature stance. Event-driven features can be valuable, often most reliably as **risk context** (hazard, clustering, gating, throttling) and sometimes as directional inputs when the half-life is long enough to trade. But they are never guaranteed, and they are especially vulnerable to timestamp ambiguity, vendor effects, language drift, and operational fragility. This notebook gives you the process that separates real signals from dataset accidents. The next step—Chapter 16—is turning signals into portfolios under constraints, and doing it with the same governance discipline you practiced here.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ssr_s-ow_tWR"}}]}
