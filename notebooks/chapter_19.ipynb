Should you buy, sell, or hold? How much risk should you take? When should you cut losses or let winners run? Traditional approaches often treat these as separate prediction problems—forecasting returns, estimating volatility, identifying regime shifts. But reinforcement learning (RL) offers a fundamentally different perspective: it optimizes the entire decision process, not just individual predictions.\n","\n","This chapter introduces you to RL for trading by building a complete, governance-ready system from the ground up. Unlike typical RL tutorials that rely on opaque libraries and toy examples, we implement everything transparently using only NumPy and Python's standard library. You'll see exactly how the algorithms work, why certain design choices matter, and where the pitfalls lie.\n","\n","**Why Reinforcement Learning?**\n","\n","Think of a discretionary trader learning their craft. They don't just study price charts—they learn through experience. Each trade teaches them something: this pattern worked in high volatility, that strategy hemorrhaged transaction costs, this risk limit saved them from ruin. RL formalizes this learning process. It treats trading as a Markov Decision Process where states (market conditions, portfolio positions) lead to actions (trades) that generate rewards (profits minus costs and penalties). The goal is to learn a policy—a decision rule—that maximizes long-run rewards while respecting real-world constraints.\n","\n","The power of RL is that it naturally incorporates everything that matters: transaction costs that erode returns, position limits that prevent catastrophic losses, drawdown penalties that capture risk aversion, and the delayed consequences of today's decisions. Unlike supervised learning models that predict \"what will happen,\" RL optimizes \"what should I do.\"\n","\n","**The Reality Check: Offline RL and Backtesting**\n","\n","But here's the critical insight this chapter emphasizes: RL for trading is hard, and most naive approaches fail spectacularly. The core challenge is that we can't experiment freely with real money. We must learn offline from historical data, then deploy in live markets—a setting where textbook RL algorithms often produce dangerously overconfident policies.\n","\n","This notebook demonstrates conservative offline RL through two stages. First, behavior cloning learns from a sensible expert policy (a simple trend-following strategy). This creates a stable baseline that captures proven trading logic. Second, conservative policy improvement makes small, cautious steps away from this baseline—improving performance while maintaining a safety margin. This mirrors how experienced traders evolve their strategies: start with what works, make incremental changes, stress-test relentlessly.\n","\n","We also confront the measurement problem head-on. Off-policy evaluation (OPE)—estimating how a new policy would perform using old data—can be wildly misleading. Small differences between the behavior policy (which generated the data) and the target policy (which we're evaluating) can cause importance sampling weights to explode, yielding useless estimates. The notebook includes a live demonstration of this phenomenon, showing why walk-forward backtests remain essential despite their limitations.\n","\n","**Governance as a First Principle**\n","\n","Finally, this chapter treats governance not as an afterthought but as a design requirement. Every decision is logged, every dataset fingerprinted, every model versioned. We generate reproducible bundles with configuration hashes, causality proofs, stress test results, and audit trails. This isn't bureaucracy—it's survival. In production trading, you must be able to explain why your system made each trade, prove it didn't peek at future data, and demonstrate robustness to cost shocks and market regime changes.\n","\n","By the end, you'll understand RL not as a magic bullet, but as a powerful tool that requires deep respect for its assumptions, careful engineering of its components, and relentless skepticism about its outputs."],"metadata":{"id":"u_oYFvM8_m_I"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"onvKbl0W6LiC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Cell 2 — Determinism + project paths + hashing utilities\n","import numpy as np\n","import json\n","import os\n","import hashlib\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import math\n","import random\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import itertools\n","\n","# Set master seed for reproducibility\n","MASTER_SEED = 42\n","np.random.seed(MASTER_SEED)\n","random.seed(MASTER_SEED)\n","\n","# Derive sub-seeds deterministically\n","def derive_seed(base_seed, label):\n","    \"\"\"Derive a sub-seed from base seed and a label.\"\"\"\n","    h = hashlib.md5(f\"{base_seed}_{label}\".encode()).digest()\n","    return int.from_bytes(h[:4], 'big') % (2**31)\n","\n","SEED_DATA = derive_seed(MASTER_SEED, \"data\")\n","SEED_TRAIN = derive_seed(MASTER_SEED, \"train\")\n","SEED_EVAL = derive_seed(MASTER_SEED, \"eval\")\n","\n","# Create run folder structure\n","run_id = datetime.now().strftime(\"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\")\n","BASE_PATH = f\"/content/ch19_runs/{run_id}\"\n","PATHS = {\n","    'base': BASE_PATH,\n","    'artifacts': f\"{BASE_PATH}/artifacts\",\n","    'plots': f\"{BASE_PATH}/plots\",\n","    'logs': f\"{BASE_PATH}/logs\",\n","    'policy': f\"{BASE_PATH}/policy\",\n","    'data': f\"{BASE_PATH}/data\"\n","}\n","\n","for path in PATHS.values():\n","    os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)\n","\n","print(f\"[INIT] Run ID: {run_id}\")\n","print(f\"[INIT] Base path: {BASE_PATH}\")\n","\n","# Hashing utilities for governance\n","def stable_hash_dict(d):\n","    \"\"\"Compute stable hash of dictionary (sorted JSON).\"\"\"\n","    s = json.dumps(d, sort_keys=True, indent=None)\n","    return hashlib.sha256(s.encode()).hexdigest()\n","\n","def file_hash(filepath):\n","    \"\"\"Compute SHA-256 hash of file.\"\"\"\n","    h = hashlib.sha256()\n","    with open(filepath, 'rb') as f:\n","        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(8192), b''):\n","            h.update(chunk)\n","    return h.hexdigest()\n","\n","def array_fingerprint(arr):\n","    \"\"\"Compute fingerprint of numpy array.\"\"\"\n","    return hashlib.sha256(arr.tobytes()).hexdigest()[:16]\n","\n","print(\"[INIT] Hashing utilities ready.\")"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"IBwzs9GlAOlX","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767029577646,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":84,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"6965bb5b-981c-477d-b544-941af7015e71"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[INIT] Run ID: 20251229_173257\n","[INIT] Base path: /content/ch19_runs/20251229_173257\n","[INIT] Hashing utilities ready.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##3.CONFIG REGISTRY"],"metadata":{"id":"TiZzcK3LAT5q"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"ks2GEVyTAYoI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","This section establishes the governance backbone of our RL trading system by creating a\n","comprehensive configuration registry and run manifest.

These are often the difference between paper profits and real losses. We make\n","them explicit and auditable.\n","\n","- **Constraint Set**: Position limits (±1.0), leverage caps, and turnover restrictions. Real\n","trading operates under risk limits—our RL agent must learn to respect them.

This eliminates a major source of confusion in RL research:\n","did performance change because we improved the algorithm, or because we got lucky with a\n","different market sample?\n","\n","**The Market Model: Regime-Switching Dynamics**\n","\n","Our synthetic market features two regimes—low volatility and high volatility—that follow a\n","Markov chain. Think of these as \"calm markets\" and \"turbulent markets.\" The system starts in\n","one regime and probabilistically transitions between them according to a transition matrix.\n","\n","- **Regime 0 (Low Volatility)**: Daily volatility of 1%, small positive drift. This represents\n","stable market conditions where trends persist and risk is moderate.\n","\n","- **Regime 1 (High Volatility)**: Daily volatility of 3%, slightly higher drift. This captures\n","turbulent periods where prices swing wildly and risk management becomes critical.\n","\n","- **Transition Probabilities**: High probability of staying in the current regime (98% for low\n","vol, 95% for high vol), low probability of switching. This creates realistic regime persistence—\n","markets don't flip between calm and chaotic every day.\n","\n","The regime sequence is generated first using the Markov chain. Then, for each timestep, returns\n","are drawn from a normal distribution with mean and variance determined by the current regime.\n","This creates heteroskedastic returns (volatility clustering) without requiring complex GARCH\n","models.\n","\n","**From Returns to Prices**\n","\n","Given the return series, we construct prices through simple compounding: each price equals the\n","previous price multiplied by (1 + return). We start at an initial price of 100, making\n","percentage changes easy to interpret. This price series is what a human trader would see on a\n","chart, while the returns are what drive P&L.\n","\n","**The Liquidity Proxy**\n","\n","Real markets aren't perfectly liquid—larger trades incur greater market impact. We model this\n","by creating a liquidity proxy inversely related to volatility: high-volatility regimes have\n","lower liquidity (trades are more expensive), while low-volatility regimes have higher liquidity.\n","We add noise to prevent the RL agent from perfectly inferring regime from liquidity alone. This\n","liquidity proxy will feed into our cost model, making transaction costs state-dependent and\n","realistic.\n","\n","**Data Governance and Fingerprinting**\n","\n","After generating the data, we immediately save it to disk in NumPy's compressed format (.npz).\n","This preserves the arrays efficiently without requiring pandas. More importantly, we compute\n","and save a data fingerprint—a hash-based signature that uniquely identifies this dataset.\n","\n","The fingerprint JSON records:\n","\n","- Instrument identifier (synthetic_1)\n","- Frequency (daily)\n","- Number of timesteps\n","- Hash of returns array (16-character hex string)\n","- Hash of prices array\n","- Missingness rate (0% for synthetic data)\n","- Corporate actions (none)\n","- Random seed used for generation\n","\n","This fingerprint serves multiple purposes. First, it lets us verify data integrity—if we\n","reload the data later, we can recompute the hash to confirm nothing corrupted. Second, it\n","provides traceability: every model trained on this data can reference this fingerprint,\n","creating an audit trail from results back to exact data sources.\n","\n","**Visualization for Sanity Checks**\n","\n","The section concludes by plotting three time series: prices, returns, and regime indicators.\n","These plots aren't just pretty pictures—they're essential sanity checks. We verify that:\n","\n","- Prices follow reasonable trajectories (no sudden jumps to infinity)\n","- Returns exhibit regime-dependent volatility clustering (visible heteroskedasticity)\n","- Regime switches occur at realistic frequencies (not too fast, not too slow)\n","\n","If something looks wrong in these plots, we catch it now, before wasting compute time training\n","on broken data.\n","\n","**The No-Pandas Constraint**\n","\n","Notice we generate everything using NumPy arrays and explicit loops.

Many academic papers and online tutorials assume frictionless\n","markets where trades execute instantly at mid-price with no fees. In reality, every trade incurs\n","multiple costs that can transform paper profits into actual losses. This section builds an explicit,\n","auditable cost model and registers it as a governed artifact.\n","\n","**The Three Components of Trading Costs**\n","\n","Our cost model decomposes transaction costs into three distinct mechanisms:\n","\n","- **Fixed Fees**: A flat 5 basis points (0.05%) per trade, representing exchange fees, clearing\n","costs, and broker commissions. This is the simplest component—it applies uniformly regardless of\n","market conditions or trade size. For a $10,000 trade, you pay $5 in fees.\n","\n","- **Bid-Ask Spread**: An additional 2 basis points capturing the cost of crossing the spread.\n","When you buy, you pay the ask price; when you sell, you receive the bid price. The difference is\n","the spread, and it represents compensation to market makers for providing liquidity. This cost is\n","unavoidable in real markets.\n","\n","- **Market Impact**: The most sophisticated component, proportional to trade size and inversely\n","proportional to liquidity. Large trades move prices against you—buying pushes prices up, selling\n","pushes them down. Our impact model scales with the absolute trade size and divides by a liquidity\n","proxy, so the same $10,000 trade costs more in illiquid (high volatility) conditions than in\n","liquid (low volatility) conditions.\n","\n","The total cost formula becomes: **(fees + spread) + (impact_coefficient × |trade_size| / liquidity)**,\n","expressed as a fraction of the notional trade amount. For a trade of 0.5 units (50% position change)\n","in normal liquidity conditions, you might pay 10-15 basis points total—small individually, but\n","devastating for high-frequency strategies.\n","\n","**Why Cost Modeling Matters**\n","\n","Transaction costs are the graveyard of trading strategies. A strategy that generates 20% annual\n","returns in simulation might produce -5% after costs in reality. High-turnover strategies are\n","particularly vulnerable: if you trade daily and each round-trip costs 20 bps, you're burning 50%\n","annually before making a single dollar in market returns.\n","\n","The RL agent must learn to trade profitably *net of costs*. By incorporating costs directly into\n","the reward function, the agent naturally learns cost-aware behavior: it avoids excessive turnover,\n","times trades to coincide with higher liquidity, and only takes positions when expected returns\n","justify the transaction costs. This is fundamentally different from training on gross returns and\n","hoping the strategy remains profitable after costs.\n","\n","**Liquidity-Dependent Costs: The Realism Factor**\n","\n","The liquidity proxy makes our cost model state-dependent and realistic. In calm market conditions\n","(low volatility regime), liquidity is high and impact costs are modest. During market turbulence\n","(high volatility regime), liquidity evaporates and the same trade size incurs much larger impact.\n","This creates a natural risk management incentive: the RL agent should trade less aggressively\n","precisely when costs are highest.\n","\n","This feature captures a key aspect of real market microstructure that simpler models miss. It also\n","creates interesting strategic trade-offs: should you exit a losing position immediately (incurring\n","high costs in volatile conditions) or wait for calmer markets (risking further losses but paying\n","lower costs)?\n","\n","**The Cost Model Registry as Governance**\n","\n","Rather than hiding the cost function in the code, we create an explicit registry document that\n","lives alongside our results. This JSON file records:\n","\n","- Model version identifier (v1.0)\n","- Mathematical formula in plain text\n","- All parameter values (fee_bps, spread_bps, impact_coeff)\n","- Units and interpretation\n","- Sensitivity grid for stress testing\n","\n","This registry serves multiple governance functions. First, it makes our assumptions transparent—\n","anyone auditing our results can see exactly what cost model we used. Second, it enables systematic\n","sensitivity analysis: we pre-define cost inflation factors (1.0×, 1.5×, 2.0×) that we'll use in\n","stress tests. Third, it creates version control: if we later improve the cost model, we can track\n","which results used which version.\n","\n","**The Execution Timing Convention**\n","\n","Alongside costs, this section establishes our execution timing convention: decisions made at time\n","*t* execute at time *t+1* using the *t+1* price. This one-step delay is critical for causality—it\n","ensures the agent cannot cheat by \"trading on\" information it shouldn't have. When you decide to\n","buy at 3 PM, you don't get the 3 PM price; you get the price when your order fills, which might be\n","seconds, minutes, or hours later.\n","\n","This delay also naturally incorporates latency and eliminates look-ahead bias. The RL agent can\n","only use information available *before* making the decision. The realized return and executed price\n","come *after* the decision, creating proper causal ordering.\n","\n","**Practical Impact on Strategy Design**\n","\n","By making costs explicit, auditable, and realistic, this section fundamentally shapes what the RL\n","agent can learn. Strategies that work in frictionless markets—like daily rebalancing to exact\n","portfolio targets—become unprofitable once costs are included. The agent must discover cost-effective\n","approaches: longer holding periods, tolerance bands around targets, and liquidity-aware execution.\n","\n","This is governance in action: not just documenting what we did, but designing the system so that\n","what we learn is actually deployable in reality."],"metadata":{"id":"wgsrxDfqByhF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###5.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"FfD0FFJ4By0k"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# Cell 5 — Cost model registry + execution model\n","def compute_trading_cost(trade_size, liquidity, config):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Compute trading cost for a given trade.\n","    Cost = fees + spread + impact\n","\n","    trade_size: absolute value of position change\n","    liquidity: liquidity proxy (higher = more liquid)\n","    \"\"\"\n","    fee_bps = config['costs']['fee_bps']\n","    spread_bps = config['costs']['spread_bps']\n","    impact_coeff = config['costs']['impact_coeff']\n","\n","    # Base cost in bps\n","    base_cost = fee_bps + spread_bps\n","\n","    # Impact cost (proportional to trade size and inverse of liquidity)\n","    if config['costs']['liquidity_proxy']:\n","        impact_bps = impact_coeff * abs(trade_size) * 1000 / liquidity\n","    else:\n","        impact_bps = impact_coeff * abs(trade_size) * 1000\n","\n","    total_cost_bps = base_cost + impact_bps\n","    total_cost_fraction = total_cost_bps / 10000.0\n","\n","    return total_cost_fraction\n","\n","# Create cost model registry\n","cost_model_registry = {\n","    'model_version': 'v1.0',\n","    'formula': 'cost = fees + spread + impact * |trade| / liquidity',\n","    'parameters': CONFIG['costs'],\n","    'units': 'fraction of trade notional',\n","    'notes': 'Impact cost is proportional to trade size and inversely proportional to liquidity proxy.',\n","    'sensitivity_grid': {\n","        'fee_inflation': [1.0, 1.5, 2.0],\n","        'spread_inflation': [1.0, 1.5, 2.0],\n","        'impact_inflation': [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]\n","    }\n","}\n","\n","cost_registry_path = f\"{PATHS['artifacts']}/cost_model_registry.json\"\n","with open(cost_registry_path, 'w') as f:\n","    json.dump(cost_model_registry, f, indent=2)\n","\n","print(\"[COSTS] Cost model registry saved.\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"J97ETqzMCJNE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1767029578554,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":29,"user":{"displayName":"Alejandro Reynoso del Valle","userId":"04174712603211483042"}},"outputId":"d5f3d114-0b97-4a63-ea3b-2a87d4406d9a"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[COSTS] Cost model registry saved.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##6.TRADING ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"wwv0rHsgCRjD"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###6.1.OVERVIEW"],"metadata":{"id":"qNmP_qofCT_k"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["\n","\n","This section builds the core RL infrastructure: the trading environment where our agent will learn.\n","Think of this as constructing a realistic but controlled simulation of market interaction.

This section implements\n","five baseline strategies that represent different trading philosophies, from passive to rule-based\n","to greedy optimization. These baselines serve three critical purposes: they provide context for\n","evaluating the RL agent, they generate expert demonstrations for behavior cloning, and they reveal\n","what's achievable without sophisticated learning algorithms.\n","\n","**Why Baselines Are Non-Negotiable**\n","\n","A common mistake in RL research is reporting that \"our agent achieved 15% returns\" without context.\n","Is 15% good? It depends—what did simple alternatives achieve? If buy-and-hold earned 20% with lower\n","risk, your fancy RL agent is worthless. Baselines transform absolute performance metrics into\n","relative assessments: the RL agent must beat sensible alternatives to justify its complexity.\n","\n","Moreover, baselines expose environment bugs. If even the simplest strategy produces nonsensical\n","results, something is wrong with the environment, costs, or reward function. It's much easier to\n","debug a 3-line baseline than a complex RL algorithm.\n","\n","**Baseline 1: Cash (Do-Nothing)**\n","\n","The simplest possible strategy: hold zero position at all times. This earns exactly 0% return and\n","incurs zero costs. It represents the null hypothesis—the performance floor that any active strategy\n","must beat. Surprisingly, many trading strategies fail to beat cash after accounting for costs and\n","risk.\n","\n","Cash also serves as the reference point for Sharpe ratio calculations. If your strategy earns 5%\n","but with 20% volatility (Sharpe = 0.25), you might be better off staying in cash and sleeping well.\n","\n","**Baseline 2: Buy-and-Hold**\n","\n","Take a constant long position (+1.0) and hold forever. This captures pure market beta—you earn\n","whatever the market delivers, minus the initial transaction cost to establish the position. In\n","trending markets, buy-and-hold can be surprisingly effective. In mean-reverting or declining markets,\n","it suffers.\n","\n","This baseline is particularly important for our synthetic data because we've embedded small positive\n","drift in both regimes. Buy-and-hold should earn positive returns on average, though it will experience\n","drawdowns during high-volatility periods. If buy-and-hold produces negative returns, we've\n","misconfigured our market generator.\n","\n","**Baseline 3: Trend Following with Volatility Targeting**\n","\n","This rule-based strategy represents classic technical analysis: compute the average of recent returns\n","(lookback window), take positions in the direction of this trend, and scale position size inversely\n","with volatility. When recent returns are positive, go long; when negative, go short. When volatility\n","is high, reduce position size; when low, increase it.\n","\n","The volatility targeting is crucial—it implements rudimentary risk management without complex\n","optimization. By scaling exposure inversely with volatility, the strategy naturally reduces risk\n","during turbulent periods (high-vol regime) and increases it during calm periods (low-vol regime).\n","\n","This baseline often performs remarkably well, especially in markets with momentum and regime\n","persistence. It will serve as our \"expert\" policy for behavior cloning because it encodes sensible\n","trading logic: follow trends, manage risk dynamically, respect volatility.\n","\n","**Baseline 4: Myopic (Greedy One-Step)**\n","\n","This strategy makes locally optimal decisions without considering long-term consequences. At each\n","timestep, it forecasts the next return (using average of recent returns), computes the position that\n","would maximize one-step-ahead expected reward (accounting for costs), and takes that position.\n","\n","Myopic strategies are \"greedy\"—they optimize immediate payoff rather than long-run value. In some\n","environments this works well; in others it fails because it ignores delayed costs like drawdown\n","accumulation or constraint violations that hurt future options. This baseline tests whether\n","short-term optimization suffices or whether we need genuine sequential decision-making.\n","\n","The implementation scales position by forecast strength and inverse volatility, then clips to\n","constraint bounds. It's essentially a simplified optimal execution strategy for a one-period horizon.\n","\n","**Baseline 5: Imitation (Behavior Cloning Preview)**\n","\n","This baseline will be added after we train the behavior cloning policy in Cell 8. It represents pure\n","imitation learning: the agent mimics the trend-following expert without attempting improvement. This\n","lets us measure the cost of imperfect imitation—how much performance degrades when we approximate\n","the expert with a parameterized policy rather than executing its logic directly.\n","\n","**Evaluation Protocol and Metrics**\n","\n","Each baseline runs on a common evaluation window (steps 100-1100), using the same environment, costs,\n","and constraints. We compute a comprehensive metric suite for each:\n","\n","- **Net Return**: Final equity minus initial equity (1.0)\n","- **Volatility**: Standard deviation of equity returns\n","- **Sharpe Ratio**: Mean return divided by volatility (simple annualized form)\n","- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline in equity\n","- **Total Turnover**: Sum of absolute position changes\n","- **Average Cost**: Mean transaction cost per step\n","- **Constraint Violation Rate**: Fraction of steps where constraints were breached\n","\n","These metrics capture both performance (returns, Sharpe) and implementation reality (turnover, costs,\n","violations). A strategy with high returns but catastrophic drawdowns or excessive violations is not\n","deployable, regardless of its Sharpe ratio.\n","\n","**Visualization and Sanity Checks**\n","\n","The section plots equity curves for all baselines on a single chart. This visual comparison is\n","incredibly informative:\n","\n","- Do equity curves grow over time? (If not, our market has no edge to exploit)\n","- Which strategy handles the high-volatility regime better?\n","- Does trend-following outperform buy-and-hold? (It should, given our regime structure)\n","- Are there periods where all strategies fail simultaneously? (Suggests fundamental market difficulty)\n","\n","These plots also reveal bugs immediately. If a baseline produces negative infinity equity or jumps\n","discontinuously, we have an implementation error.\n","\n","**The Baseline Results as Ground Truth**\n","\n","The JSON file saved at the end contains baseline metrics that become our performance targets. The RL\n","agent must beat trend-following (our best baseline) to justify its existence. If RL achieves 1.2x\n","return vs. trend's 1.39x, we've failed—the added complexity isn't worth the performance loss.\n","\n","These baselines also calibrate our expectations. If the best baseline achieves Sharpe 90 (due to our\n","benign synthetic environment), we know this is an \"easy\" problem. On real data with Sharpe < 2, we'd\n","adjust our success criteria accordingly."],"metadata":{"id":"oyt6ThsODuKf"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"slIHJIVLDumD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Cell 7 — Baseline strategies\n","def run_episode(env, policy_fn, start_idx, end_idx):\n","    \"\"\"Run a single episode with given policy.\"\"\"\n","    state = env.reset(start_idx, end_idx)\n","    done = False\n","\n","    trajectory = {\n","        'states': [],\n","        'actions': [],\n","        'rewards': [],\n","        'infos': []\n","    }\n","\n","    while not done:\n","        action = policy_fn(state, env)\n","        trajectory['states'].append(state)\n","        trajectory['actions'].append(action)\n","\n","        next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action)\n","        trajectory['rewards'].append(reward)\n","        trajectory['infos'].append(info)\n","\n","        state = next_state\n","\n","    return trajectory\n","\n","def cash_baseline(state, env):\n","    \"\"\"Do-nothing baseline: stay in cash.\"\"\"\n","    return 0.0\n","\n","def buy_hold_baseline(state, env):\n","    \"\"\"Buy-and-hold baseline: constant position.\"\"\"\n","    return env.pos_max\n","\n","def trend_baseline(state, env):\n","    \"\"\"Rule-based trend following with volatility targeting.\"\"\"\n","    # Use mean of recent returns (from state's lagged returns)\n","    lagged_returns = state[:env.lookback]\n","    mean_return = np.mean(lagged_returns)\n","\n","    # Volatility from state\n","    vol = state[env.lookback]  # rolling_vol is at this index\n","\n","    # Vol targeting: scale position by inverse of vol\n","    target_vol = 0.02\n","    if vol > 0:\n","        scale = target_vol / vol\n","    else:\n","        scale = 1.0\n","\n","    # Position = sign(trend) * scale\n","    if mean_return > 0:\n","        position = min(scale * env.pos_max, env.pos_max)\n","    elif mean_return < 0:\n","        position = max(-scale * env.pos_max, env.pos_min)\n","    else:\n","        position = 0.0\n","\n","    return position\n","\n","def myopic_baseline(state, env):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Myopic baseline: greedy one-step optimization.\n","    Use simple linear forecast of next return from state.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    # Simple forecast: use mean of recent returns\n","    lagged_returns = state[:env.lookback]\n","    forecast = np.mean(lagged_returns)\n","\n","    # Greedy position to maximize expected reward (with cost consideration)\n","    # If forecast > 0, go long;

Unlike online RL where agents explore\n","freely in live environments, offline RL must learn exclusively from historical data—a constraint that\n","matches real-world trading where experimentation with actual capital is prohibitively expensive and\n","risky.\n","\n","**The Offline RL Challenge**\n","\n","Imagine learning to drive by watching videos of expert drivers, without ever touching a steering wheel\n","until your first highway commute. That's offline RL. You can't experiment, can't try risky maneuvers\n","to see what happens, can't explore actions the expert never took. You must learn a good policy from\n","someone else's demonstrated behavior.\n","\n","This creates a fundamental problem: if you try to learn a policy that's too different from the\n","demonstrations, you're optimizing in regions of state-action space where you have no data. Your\n","value estimates become wildly optimistic (the \"extrapolation error\" problem), and your learned policy\n","fails catastrophically when deployed. Conservative offline RL addresses this by staying close to the\n","demonstrated behavior while making small, justified improvements.\n","\n","**Stage 1: Behavior Cloning (BC) - Learning from the Expert**\n","\n","Behavior cloning is supervised learning applied to RL: we treat the expert's state-action pairs as\n","a dataset and train a policy to mimic them. Our expert is the trend-following baseline from Cell 7—\n","a sensible strategy that respects constraints and earns positive returns.\n","\n","We collect expert trajectories by running the trend baseline for 8 episodes (each spanning 100 steps)\n","across the training window. This generates roughly 800 state-action pairs: states the expert\n","encountered and actions it chose. Our goal is to learn a parameterized policy (a linear model with\n","weights W and bias b) that approximates this expert behavior.\n","\n","The training process minimizes mean squared error between the expert's actions and the policy's\n","predictions. Over 100 epochs, we perform stochastic gradient descent:\n","\n","- Sample a random batch of state-action pairs\n","- Predict actions using current policy parameters\n","- Compute MSE loss between predictions and expert actions\n","- Calculate gradients of loss with respect to policy parameters\n","- Update parameters to reduce loss\n","\n","The loss curve tracks training progress—it should decrease and stabilize. If loss remains high, our\n","linear model is too simple to capture the expert's logic. If loss crashes to zero too quickly, we're\n","overfitting.\n","\n","**Why Linear Policies?**\n","\n","We deliberately use a simple linear policy (action = W^T · state + b, clipped to bounds) rather than\n","deep neural networks. This transparency is pedagogical—you can inspect the learned weights and\n","understand what features the policy relies on. It's also practical—linear policies generalize better\n","from limited data and are less prone to the extrapolation errors that plague deep RL.\n","\n","In production systems, simplicity is a feature, not a bug. A linear policy can be audited, stress-\n","tested, and debugged much more easily than a black-box neural network with millions of parameters.\n","\n","**Stage 2: Conservative Policy Improvement (CPI) - Careful Optimization**\n","\n","Behavior cloning gives us a safe baseline policy that mimics the expert.

Conservative policy improvement achieves this through\n","constrained optimization: maximize expected reward while penalizing deviation from the BC policy.\n","\n","The CPI algorithm performs a small number of gradient steps (5 in our configuration) where each step:\n","\n","- Evaluates the current policy by running it in the environment\n","- Estimates the policy gradient (how to adjust parameters to increase reward)\n","- Computes a deviation penalty gradient (how much we're drifting from BC policy)\n","- Updates parameters in the direction that increases reward minus deviation penalty\n","\n","The deviation penalty is crucial—it's a \"trust region\" that prevents the policy from wandering into\n","uncharted territory. We're essentially saying: \"improve, but don't change so much that we're no\n","longer confident in our value estimates.\"\n","\n","**Gradient Estimation via Finite Differences**\n","\n","Since we're implementing RL from scratch without automatic differentiation libraries, we estimate\n","gradients using finite differences. For each policy parameter, we:\n","\n","- Perturb it slightly upward (+epsilon)\n","- Measure the resulting average reward\n","- Perturb it downward (-epsilon)\n","- Measure the reward again\n","- Gradient ≈ (reward_up - reward_down) / (2 × epsilon)\n","\n","This is computationally expensive (requires running the environment multiple times per parameter), so\n","we sample only a subset of parameters per iteration. In production systems, you'd use proper\n","automatic differentiation, but finite differences makes the learning process completely transparent.\n","\n","**The Conservative Philosophy**\n","\n","Notice we take only 5 CPI steps, not 100 or 1000. This conservatism is intentional. Each step moves\n","us farther from the demonstrated behavior, increasing extrapolation risk. After a few steps, we're\n","making decisions in states the expert rarely visited, with actions the expert rarely chose. Our\n","value estimates become unreliable, and further optimization is likely to find spurious patterns rather\n","than genuine improvements.\n","\n","This mirrors how expert traders develop new strategies: start with proven techniques, make small\n","modifications, validate extensively, and stop before you've \"optimized yourself into a corner\" by\n","overfitting to historical quirks.\n","\n","**Training Traces and Transparency**\n","\n","Throughout training, we log everything: BC loss per epoch, CPI reward per step, number of training\n","samples, episodes collected. These traces get saved to JSON and plotted for visual inspection. The\n","plots reveal:\n","\n","- Does BC loss converge smoothly? (Indicates successful imitation learning)\n","- Does CPI improve reward over BC? (Validates the improvement mechanism)\n","- Are improvements monotonic or noisy? (Suggests stability or instability)\n","\n","If CPI reward decreases or fluctuates wildly, something is wrong—bad gradient estimates, poor learning\n","rate, or the policy is leaving the safe region.\n","\n","**Policy Serialization and Governance**\n","\n","Both the BC policy and CPI policy get saved to disk as .npz files containing the learned weights and\n","bias. This creates reproducible policy artifacts—we can reload these exact policies months later and\n","get identical behavior. Each policy file is time-stamped and linked to the run manifest, creating a\n","complete audit trail from training data to learned parameters to evaluation results.\n","\n","**The Pedagogical Payoff**\n","\n","By implementing RL transparently rather than calling library functions, we've demystified the learning\n","process. Behavior cloning is just supervised learning. Policy improvement is just gradient ascent with\n","a penalty term. There's no magic—just optimization under constraints, implemented with basic NumPy\n","operations that you can inspect, modify, and trust."],"metadata":{"id":"kPAVUhA6EhqF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###8.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"mY_suDemEiUS"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","class LinearPolicy:\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Simple linear policy for continuous actions.\n","    action = clip(W^T state + b, pos_min, pos_max)\n","    \"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, state_dim, pos_min, pos_max, seed=None):\n","        if seed is not None:\n","            np.random.seed(seed)\n","        self.W = np.random.randn(state_dim) * 0.01\n","        self.b = 0.0\n","        self.pos_min = pos_min\n","        self.pos_max = pos_max\n","\n","    def predict(self, state):\n","        \"\"\"Predict action for given state.\"\"\"\n","        action = np.dot(self.W, state) + self.b\n","        return np.clip(action, self.pos_min, self.pos_max)\n","\n","    def get_params(self):\n","        \"\"\"Get policy parameters.\"\"\"\n","        return {'W': self.W.copy(), 'b': self.b}\n","\n","    def set_params(self, params):\n","        \"\"\"Set policy parameters.\"\"\"\n","        self.W = params['W'].copy()\n","        self.b = params['b']\n","\n","def collect_expert_trajectories(env, expert_policy_fn, n_episodes, start_idx, end_idx, step=100):\n","    \"\"\"Collect trajectories from expert policy.\"\"\"\n","    trajectories = []\n","\n","    for i in range(n_episodes):\n","        ep_start = start_idx + i * step\n","        ep_end = min(ep_start + step, end_idx)\n","        if ep_end -

This eliminates look-ahead bias completely.\n","\n","**Why Single Train-Test Splits Fail**\n","\n","A single split is dangerous because it might get lucky. Perhaps your test period happened to be\n","unusually favorable for your strategy. Or perhaps your model picked up patterns specific to your\n","particular split point. Walk-forward testing averages over multiple test periods, revealing whether\n","performance is robust or fragile.\n","\n","Moreover, markets are non-stationary—patterns that worked in 2020 may fail in 2023. Walk-forward\n","testing forces your strategy to prove itself across different regimes represented in different folds.\n","If performance collapses in fold 2, you know your strategy doesn't generalize across time.\n","\n","**The Evaluation Protocol**\n","\n","For each fold, we evaluate six policies: cash, buy-and-hold, trend, myopic, BC policy, and CPI\n","policy.

This creates an apples-to-apples comparison.\n","\n","For our RL policies (BC and CPI), note that we don't retrain them per fold in this implementation—\n","we trained them once in Cell 8 and now evaluate the frozen policies across all folds. In a production\n","system, you'd retrain per fold using only data available up to that fold's training cutoff. Our\n","simplified approach still captures the essential insight: does the policy work out-of-sample?\n","\n","**Comprehensive Metrics Per Fold**\n","\n","For each policy on each fold, we compute the full metric suite:\n","\n","- **Net Return**: Absolute performance measure—did you make money?\n","- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted performance—did you make money efficiently?\n","- **Maximum Drawdown**: Worst-case risk measure—how much could you lose from peak?\n","- **Turnover**: Trading intensity—how much churn?\n","- **Average Cost**: Transaction cost burden—how much went to friction?\n","- **Violation Rate**: Constraint compliance—did you breach risk limits?\n","\n","These metrics tell different stories. A policy might have high returns but terrible drawdowns (not\n","deployable). Another might have mediocre returns but excellent Sharpe and low turnover (highly\n","deployable).

Consistent\n","outperformance suggests robust advantage; inconsistent results suggest luck or overfitting.\n","\n","- **Degradation**: Does performance decline from early folds to late folds? This signals that the\n","policy is becoming obsolete as market conditions drift away from training data characteristics.\n","\n","- **Relative Rankings**: Do the same strategies dominate across folds? If trend beats myopic in\n","fold 0 but loses in fold 2, the market structure has fundamentally changed.\n","\n","- **Drawdown Timing**: Do all strategies suffer drawdowns simultaneously? This indicates systematic\n","market difficulty (unavoidable). If only your RL policy suffers while baselines survive, your\n","policy has a specific vulnerability.\n","\n","**Equity Curve Visualization**\n","\n","The per-fold equity curve plots provide intuitive visual assessment. We plot trend, BC policy, and\n","CPI policy on each fold:\n","\n","- Smooth upward slopes indicate consistent profitability\n","- Flat regions indicate periods of poor performance or churning\n","- Sharp drops indicate drawdown events\n","- Crossing curves show relative performance shifts\n","\n","If the CPI policy equity curve dominates trend throughout, we have visual evidence of improvement.\n","If curves cross repeatedly, performance is regime-dependent and neither strategy is uniformly superior.\n","\n","**The Three-Fold Limit**\n","\n","We limit evaluation to three folds for computational efficiency in this pedagogical notebook. In\n","production, you'd run dozens of folds covering years of history. More folds provide better statistical\n","power to distinguish true alpha from noise.

This technique—off-policy evaluation (OPE)—is theoretically elegant but\n","practically treacherous. We show exactly why naive OPE fails and why walk-forward backtests remain\n","irreplaceable despite their limitations.\n","\n","**The Off-Policy Evaluation Dream**\n","\n","Imagine you have historical data from trading with strategy A (the \"behavior policy\"). You develop\n","a new strategy B (the \"target policy\"). Can you estimate B's performance without actually trading it?\n","If yes, you could test thousands of strategies instantly, finding winners without risking capital.\n","This is the OPE promise.\n","\n","The standard approach is importance sampling: reweight the observed rewards by the probability ratio\n","of actions under the two policies. If an action was likely under B but unlikely under A, upweight\n","its reward. If unlikely under B but common under A, downweight it. In theory, this corrects for the\n","distribution mismatch and gives an unbiased estimate of B's expected return.\n","\n","**Why It Fails: The Distribution Mismatch Problem**\n","\n","The demonstration uses our trend-following baseline as the behavior policy and the CPI policy as\n","the target. We run the behavior policy through the environment, collecting a trajectory of states,\n","actions, and rewards. Then we compute what actions the target policy would have chosen in those\n","same states.\n","\n","The first red flag appears in the \"support\" metric: how often does the target policy choose actions\n","similar to the behavior policy? We compute the average absolute difference between target and\n","behavior actions, and the fraction of timesteps where they differ by less than 0.1 units.\n","\n","If support is low—meaning the policies frequently disagree—importance sampling becomes dangerous.\n","You're trying to estimate performance in regions of action space that the behavior policy rarely\n","explored. Your weights will be extreme, and your estimates will be unreliable.\n","\n","**The Importance Sampling Weight Explosion**\n","\n","For continuous action spaces, we approximate importance sampling using Gaussian likelihoods. The\n","weight for each timestep is:\n","\n","**weight_t = P(observed_action | state, target_policy) / P(observed_action | state, behavior_policy)**\n","\n","When the target policy strongly prefers a different action than what was observed, this weight\n","becomes very large. When it strongly dislikes the observed action, the weight becomes very small.\n","The product of these weights across timesteps compounds the problem—a few large weights can dominate\n","the entire estimate.\n","\n","We compute the importance sampling estimate of the target policy's return by multiplying each\n","observed reward by its weight and summing. We also compute the variance of weights—a diagnostic for\n","estimator quality. High variance means the estimate is dominated by a few lucky (or unlucky)\n","timesteps rather than being a stable average.\n","\n","**Ground Truth Comparison**\n","\n","The critical step is computing the true target policy return by actually running it in the environment.\n","This gives us ground truth for comparison. The importance sampling error is the absolute difference\n","between the IS estimate and the true return.\n","\n","In typical cases, the IS estimate is wildly off—sometimes predicting 50% higher returns than reality,\n","sometimes 30% lower. The estimator is not just noisy (which we could tolerate with enough data)—it's\n","biased because the policies operate in different regions of state-action space.\n","\n","**The Weight Variance Plot**\n","\n","The visualization of importance sampling weights over time is particularly revealing. Weights should\n","hover around 1.0 if the policies are similar. Instead, we often see:\n","\n","- Weights ranging from 0.01 to 100 or more\n","- Sudden spikes where a single timestep gets enormous weight\n","- Long stretches where weights are near zero (the observed actions were \"surprising\" under the\n","target policy)\n","\n","This instability means a few timesteps dominate the estimate. If those timesteps happened to have\n","unusually good or bad rewards by chance, the entire estimate is contaminated. Adding more data\n","doesn't help—the fundamental problem is distribution mismatch, not sample size.\n","\n","**Why This Matters for Trading**\n","\n","In academic RL benchmarks (robot control, games), policies often share similar action distributions\n","because they're solving the same task. In trading, different strategies can be radically different:\n","\n","- A trend-follower takes large positions during momentum\n","- A mean-reversion trader does the opposite\n","- A risk-parity strategy rebalances to constant volatility\n","\n","Trying to evaluate a mean-reversion policy using trend-following data is hopeless—the policies\n","disagree on almost every state. The importance weights explode, and estimates become meaningless.\n","\n","**The Conservative Alternative: Bounded Estimates**\n","\n","The demonstration saves an OPE demo report with a stark warning: \"Naive OPE can be highly biased\n","and high-variance when policies differ significantly.\" We also compute the maximum importance weight\n","and weight variance as diagnostic metrics.\n","\n","Some research proposes conservative OPE methods that provide lower bounds on performance rather than\n","point estimates. If you can prove the target policy will earn at least X%, that's actionable even if\n","you can't pin down the exact value. But even these methods struggle when distribution mismatch is\n","severe.\n","\n","**The Uncomfortable Conclusion**\n","\n","Off-policy evaluation is not a substitute for actual backtesting. You cannot reliably predict how a\n","new trading strategy will perform by analyzing old data collected under a different strategy. The\n","math looks elegant, but the assumptions (sufficient overlap between behavior and target distributions)\n","are routinely violated in practice.\n","\n","This is why Cell 9's walk-forward backtests are essential. We actually run the policy in the\n","environment, observing what it does and what rewards it receives. There's no distribution mismatch,\n","no importance weights, no extrapolation. The backtest is a direct simulation of deployment.\n","\n","Yes, backtests have their own problems—they assume our environment model (costs, execution, market\n","dynamics) is correct.

Stress testing reveals these vulnerabilities before they destroy real capital, transforming\n","abstract performance metrics into actionable risk assessments.\n","\n","**The Stress Testing Philosophy**\n","\n","Backtests tell you what happened in one particular history. Stress tests tell you what could happen\n","under conditions your training data didn't cover. This is crucial because:\n","\n","- Markets are non-stationary—future conditions will differ from the past\n","- Tail events (crises, flash crashes) are underrepresented in historical data\n","- Operational reality often diverges from assumptions (costs increase, systems slow down)\n","- Regulatory changes or market structure shifts can invalidate assumptions overnight\n","\n","A strategy that looks robust in backtests but collapses under 2× cost inflation is not deployable.\n","Stress testing exposes these fragilities while you can still fix them—or decide not to deploy.\n","\n","**Stress Test 1: Cost Inflation**\n","\n","We systematically inflate all cost components (fees, spreads, impact) by factors of 1.0×, 1.5×, and\n","2.0×. This simulates:\n","\n","- Moving to a more expensive broker or exchange\n","- Trading during periods of elevated bid-ask spreads\n","- Scaling up position sizes where impact costs grow superlinearly\n","- Regulatory changes that impose higher transaction taxes\n","\n","We re-run all policies under each cost scenario and compare performance degradation. A robust policy\n","should gracefully degrade—returns decline, but not catastrophically. A fragile policy might flip\n","from +20% to -10% returns under 2× costs, indicating it was profitable only because we underestimated\n","friction.\n","\n","The key insight: high-turnover strategies are disproportionately sensitive to cost inflation. If your\n","RL policy trades daily and each round-trip costs 15 bps at 1× costs, that's 37.5% annual cost drag.\n","At 2× costs, you're burning 75% annually before earning any market returns. Meanwhile, a low-turnover\n","baseline might barely notice the cost increase.\n","\n","**Stress Test 2: Latency Shifts**\n","\n","Our baseline assumption is execution at t+1 (one-step delay). But what if your system slows down and\n","executes at t+2? Or network congestion adds variable delays? This stress test acknowledges that\n","execution lag is not a constant—it varies with market conditions, system load, and infrastructure\n","reliability.\n","\n","We note this stress test as a \"placeholder\" in the implementation because fully implementing variable\n","latency requires modifying the environment step function. In production systems, you'd run Monte\n","Carlo simulations with latency drawn from empirical distributions measured in your actual trading\n","infrastructure.\n","\n","The pedagogical point stands: latency kills alpha. If your strategy relies on rapidly exploiting\n","mean reversion, adding one extra step of delay might eliminate all profits. Signal-to-noise ratio\n","decays exponentially with latency in high-frequency contexts, and even daily strategies suffer if\n","orders sit in queues during volatile periods.\n","\n","**Stress Test 3: Liquidity Shocks**\n","\n","We multiply the liquidity proxy by factors of 1.0× (baseline) and 0.5× (liquidity crisis). Halving\n","liquidity doubles the market impact component of transaction costs for the same trade size. This\n","simulates:\n","\n","- Flash crashes where liquidity providers withdraw\n","- Crisis periods (2008, March 2020) when market depth collapses\n","- Moving from large-cap to mid-cap or small-cap instruments\n","- End-of-quarter rebalancing when everyone trades simultaneously\n","\n","The environment's liquidity-dependent cost model means impact costs increase as liquidity falls. A\n","strategy that traded 0.5 units comfortably in normal conditions might face punitive costs in the\n","liquidity shock scenario, forcing it to either trade less or accept larger slippage.\n","\n","We re-run our policies with degraded liquidity and measure performance changes. A well-designed RL\n","policy should adapt—recognizing higher costs in its state representation (via recent cost history or\n","volatility proxies) and reducing turnover accordingly. A poorly designed policy will blindly execute\n","the same high-turnover approach, incinerating returns through excessive impact.\n","\n","**Stress Test 4: Regime Slicing**\n","\n","Rather than evaluating on the full test period (which mixes regimes), we slice performance by regime:\n","evaluate separately on low-volatility periods and high-volatility periods. This reveals regime-\n","dependent fragility.\n","\n","For each regime, we identify contiguous segments where the regime indicator equals the target value,\n","then run policies on those segments. The results often show:\n","\n","- Some policies thrive in calm markets but crash in turbulent ones\n","- Others are regime-agnostic—stable across both conditions\n","- The RL policy might exploit regime-switching effectively if it learned to recognize regimes in\n","state features\n","\n","Regime slicing is particularly important for strategies marketed as \"all-weather.\" If your strategy\n","earns 30% in low-vol regimes but loses 40% in high-vol regimes, and volatility clustering means\n","you'll eventually hit extended high-vol periods, your strategy is a ticking time bomb.\n","\n","**Comparative Stress Analysis**\n","\n","The critical output is not absolute performance under stress—it's relative performance compared to\n","baselines. We plot metrics across stress scenarios for trend, BC policy, and CPI policy on the same\n","axes. This reveals:\n","\n","- **Relative Robustness**: Does the RL policy degrade faster or slower than baselines under stress?\n","- **Break Points**: At what stress level does each policy become unprofitable?\n","- **Rank Reversals**: Does the CPI policy beat trend at 1× costs but lose at 2× costs? If so, its\n","advantage depends on accurate cost assumptions.\n","\n","If the RL policy dominates baselines across all stress scenarios, we have strong evidence of genuine\n","improvement. If it only wins under narrow conditions (exactly 1× costs, zero latency, full liquidity),\n","we've probably overfit to our training environment's quirks.\n","\n","**The Stress Test Grid as Pre-Registration**\n","\n","Notice we defined the stress test grid in Cell 3's configuration—before seeing any results. This\n","pre-registration prevents cherry-picking favorable scenarios. We commit to testing these specific\n","stresses regardless of outcomes, eliminating the temptation to omit tests where our policy performs\n","poorly.\n","\n","This mirrors good scientific practice: define your experiments before collecting data.

A strategy earning 30% with 40% volatility (Sharpe = 0.75) is\n","worse than one earning 15% with 10% volatility (Sharpe = 1.5). The latter delivers better risk-\n","adjusted returns and is more scalable. High returns with high volatility often stem from leverage\n","or concentration—neither is sustainable.\n","\n","**Exposure Metrics Section**\n","\n","Risk managers care deeply about how much capital is at risk at any given time:\n","\n","- **Mean Position**: Average exposure over the period—is the strategy directional (mean ≠ 0) or\n","market-neutral (mean ≈ 0)?\n","- **Max/Min Position**: Extreme exposures reached—did the strategy ever become fully levered?\n","- **Position Standard Deviation**: How much exposure varies—high variance suggests active trading\n","or regime-dependent sizing\n","\n","A strategy with mean position +0.8 is structurally long—it's betting on upward drift and will\n","suffer in bear markets.

A 50% drawdown means you need 100% returns\n","just to recover—and most investors redeem long before that point. Strategies with >40% max drawdowns,\n","even if eventually profitable, often fail due to capital flight during the drawdown period.\n","\n","The 95th percentile drawdown is useful for risk budgeting: if your typical worst drawdown is 20%,\n","you should reserve enough capital to survive 2-3× that (40-60%) to account for fat tails and non-\n","stationarity.\n","\n","**Turnover Metrics Section**\n","\n","Turnover—how much you trade—directly determines implementation costs and operational complexity:\n","\n","- **Total Turnover**: Sum of all absolute position changes—a proxy for total transaction cost burden\n","- **Average Turnover Per Step**: Typical trading intensity—daily strategies trading 0.5 units/day\n","face higher costs than weekly strategies trading the same amount\n","- **Maximum Turnover**: Largest single position change—useful for capacity planning\n","\n","High turnover isn't inherently bad if the alpha justifies it, but it creates operational challenges:\n","more execution slippage, higher cost sensitivity, greater market impact, and increased operational\n","errors. A strategy with 1000% annual turnover needs flawless execution infrastructure; one with 50%\n","turnover is forgiving.\n","\n","**Tail Risk Section**\n","\n","Return distribution tails reveal risks that volatility misses:\n","\n","- **1st and 5th Percentiles**: Left tail—how bad are the worst returns?\n","- **95th and 99th Percentiles**: Right tail—how good are the best returns?\n","\n","Symmetric tails (left and right magnitude similar) suggest Gaussian-like returns. Asymmetric tails—\n","particularly fat left tails—indicate crash risk. A strategy with 1st percentile at -10% but 99th\n","percentile at +3% has problematic negative skewness: small gains punctuated by large losses. This\n","is psychologically painful and often indicates selling volatility or picking up pennies in front of\n","steamrollers.\n","\n","**The Decision Logs: Complete Traceability**\n","\n","While the risk report provides aggregate statistics, decision logs record every individual trading\n","decision. For each timestep, we log:\n","\n","- **Step Number**: Absolute time index for linking back to market data\n","- **State Summary**: Key state features (mean lagged return, volatility, position, equity)—enough\n","to understand what the agent \"saw\"\n","- **Action**: What position the policy chose before constraint enforcement\n","- **Executed Action**: Actual position after constraint projection—reveals when constraints bound\n","- **Reward**: Immediate reward received for this decision\n","- **Cost**: Transaction cost incurred\n","- **Trade Size**: How much the position changed\n","- **Constraint Violation Flag**: Whether any hard constraints were breached\n","\n","**Why Decision-Level Logs Matter**\n","\n","These logs enable multiple critical use cases:\n","\n","- **Post-Mortem Analysis**: When a big loss occurs, you can trace back to the exact decision that\n","caused it and understand why the agent chose that action given its state observation\n","- **Regulatory Compliance**: Regulators increasingly require explainability—you must be able to\n","justify every trade\n","- **Model Debugging**: If the RL policy is behaving strangely, logs reveal whether it's seeing\n","corrupted states, violating constraints, or making sensible decisions that happen to lose money\n","- **Strategy Refinement**: Patterns in logs reveal systematic errors—perhaps the agent always trades\n","too aggressively in high-volatility states, suggesting the need for better risk adjustment\n","\n","**Dual Storage: JSON and NPZ**\n","\n","We save logs in two formats. JSON is human-readable and integrates with downstream analysis tools.\n","NPZ (compressed NumPy arrays) is efficient for large-scale numerical analysis—loading millions of\n","decisions to compute aggregate statistics. This dual storage balances interpretability and\n","computational efficiency.\n","\n","**Exposure and Turnover Time Series Plots**\n","\n","The final visualizations plot position (exposure) and trade size (turnover) over time. These plots\n","are diagnostic gold:\n","\n","- **Exposure Plot**: Smooth position changes suggest strategic repositioning; erratic changes suggest\n","noise-trading or instability\n","- **Turnover Plot**: Should be relatively stable; spikes indicate reaction to specific events or\n","constraint hits\n","- **Correlation**: Do turnover spikes coincide with volatility increases? If yes, the agent is\n","appropriately risk-managing; if no, it might be trading randomly\n","\n","These time series also reveal regime-dependent behavior. A good RL policy should show visibly\n","different exposure profiles in low-vol versus high-vol regimes—more aggressive when cheap, more\n","defensive when expensive.\n","\n","**Governance Integration**\n","\n","The risk report and decision logs aren't afterthoughts—they're first-class artifacts that live\n","alongside the policy, configuration, and evaluation results in the reproducible bundle.

While the core RL algorithms and environment structure remain identical to our\n","synthetic data version, the data acquisition, preprocessing, and interpretation layers require\n","careful engineering to bridge the gap between idealized simulations and production deployment.\n","\n","**Why Real Data Changes Everything**\n","\n","Synthetic data gave us ground truth—we knew the regime-switching parameters, the exact volatility\n","levels, the drift rates. We could verify our algorithms worked correctly because we designed the\n","problem to be solvable. Real market data offers no such comfort. We don't know the true data-\n","generating process. Regimes aren't labeled. Volatility isn't constant within regimes. Corporate\n","actions, stock splits, dividends, and market microstructure artifacts contaminate the signal.\n","Most importantly, the future genuinely doesn't resemble the past—markets evolve, participants\n","adapt, and strategies that worked in training data fail in deployment.\n","\n","This implementation confronts these realities head-on by downloading actual SPY (S&P 500 ETF)\n","data from 2020 through 2024—a period spanning the COVID crash, unprecedented monetary stimulus,\n","inflation surges, and interest rate whiplash. If our RL system can handle this non-stationarity,\n","it has a fighting chance in production.\n","\n","**The yfinance Integration: Data Acquisition Done Right**\n","\n","We use the yfinance library to download historical data, which provides a clean interface to\n","Yahoo Finance's data API. The critical choice here is `auto_adjust=True`, which automatically\n","adjusts historical prices for stock splits and dividends. This prevents artificial discontinuities\n","in our return series—without adjustment, a 2-for-1 stock split would appear as a -50% overnight\n","loss, which would completely confuse our RL agent.\n","\n","The data acquisition code is deliberately simple and transparent:\n","\n","- Create a Ticker object for the specified symbol (SPY)\n","- Call the history method with date range and auto-adjustment enabled\n","- Extract Close prices and Volume as NumPy arrays\n","- Immediately discard the pandas DataFrame—no pandas operations beyond this point\n","\n","This \"download once, convert to NumPy, forget pandas\" pattern is crucial for production systems\n","where pandas' implicit behaviors (timezone handling, reindexing, forward-filling) can introduce\n","subtle bugs. Once we have NumPy arrays, every operation is explicit and auditable.\n","\n","**Computing Returns: The First Critical Decision**\n","\n","We compute simple returns using `returns[t] = (price[t] - price[t-1]) / price[t-1]`. This is\n","the standard choice for daily equity data, but it's worth noting the alternatives we rejected:\n","\n","- **Log returns** `ln(price[t] / price[t-1])` would be more theoretically correct for multi-period\n","compounding, but simple returns are more intuitive for position-sizing decisions and are perfectly\n","adequate for daily rebalancing.\n","\n","- **Excess returns** (returns minus risk-free rate) would be theoretically purer for Sharpe ratio\n","calculations, but with near-zero risk-free rates during most of our sample period, this adjustment\n","is negligible.\n","\n","- **Risk-adjusted returns** (returns divided by volatility) would normalize for heteroskedasticity,\n","but we prefer to let our RL agent learn volatility-dependent policies rather than preprocessing\n","it away.\n","\n","After computing returns, we align the arrays—prices and volume both get truncated by one element\n","to match the returns length. This alignment discipline prevents off-by-one indexing errors that\n","plague financial data processing.\n","\n","**Liquidity Proxy: Modeling Transaction Cost Dynamics**\n","\n","Real markets aren't uniformly liquid. A $10,000 trade costs more during market stress than during\n","calm periods. We model this through a volume-based liquidity proxy that feeds into our impact\n","cost calculation.\n","\n","The construction is deliberately simple: divide current volume by the 20-day moving average of\n","volume, then clip extreme values. When today's volume is 2× the recent average, liquidity is high\n","(proxy = 2.0) and impact costs are halved. When volume is 0.5× average, liquidity is low\n","(proxy = 0.5) and impact costs double.\n","\n","This proxy is crude—sophisticated systems would use order book depth, bid-ask spreads, and\n","intraday volume patterns—but it captures the essential feature: transaction costs are state-\n","dependent and anti-cyclical. They spike precisely when you most want to trade (during volatility\n","surges and regime shifts).\n","\n","**Synthetic Regime Labels: Inferring Hidden Structure**\n","\n","Our synthetic data had explicit regime labels (0 = low vol, 1 = high vol) because we generated\n","them from a Markov chain. Real data has no such labels—regimes are latent variables we must infer.\n","\n","We create approximate regime labels by comparing recent realized volatility to a rolling median\n","threshold. If the 20-day standard deviation exceeds 1.5× the historical median, we label it\n","high-volatility (regime 1); otherwise, low-volatility (regime 0).\n","\n","This is admittedly circular—we're using volatility to infer regimes, then including regime\n","probabilities in our state. A more sophisticated approach would use Hidden Markov Models or\n","change-point detection to identify structural breaks. But our simple heuristic suffices to\n","demonstrate the concept: real-world RL systems need some mechanism for detecting regime changes\n","because strategies that work in calm markets often fail in crises.\n","\n","Critically, we compute these regime labels using only past data (rolling window ending at t),\n","preserving causality. A smoothing filter that uses future data would leak information and\n","invalidate our backtests.\n","\n","**Data Fingerprinting: Cryptographic Audit Trails**\n","\n","After downloading and processing, we immediately compute cryptographic fingerprints (SHA-256\n","hashes) of the returns and prices arrays. These fingerprints serve multiple governance functions:\n","\n","- **Reproducibility verification**: If you re-run this code months later and get different\n","fingerprints, something changed—Yahoo Finance revised their data, you downloaded a different date\n","range, or a processing bug was introduced.\n","\n","- **Data lineage tracking**: Every model trained on this data can reference these fingerprints,\n","creating an audit trail from results back to exact data sources.\n","\n","- **Version control for data**: Just as we version code with Git, we version datasets with\n","fingerprints. When you update from 2020-2023 data to 2020-2024 data, the fingerprint changes,\n","and you can track which results used which version.\n","\n","The fingerprint JSON also records metadata: ticker symbol, date range, data source (yfinance),\n","and corporate action handling (auto-adjusted). This metadata answers questions that arise months\n","later: \"Did this backtest include dividends?\" \"Which data vendor did we use?\" \"What dates did\n","this cover?\"\n","\n","**Configuration Differences: Adapting Parameters for Real Data**\n","\n","The configuration dictionary looks similar to our synthetic version, but several parameters changed\n","to reflect real market realities:\n","\n","- **Shorter evaluation windows** (400 training steps, 100 test steps instead of 800/200) because\n","we have fewer total timesteps (roughly 1,200 trading days vs. 2,000 synthetic days).\n","\n","- **More conservative training** (fewer expert trajectories, fewer CPI steps) because real data\n","is noisier and overfitting is a greater risk.\n","\n","- **No regime slicing in stress tests** because our regime labels are crude synthetic constructs\n","rather than true ground truth.\n","\n","These adaptations acknowledge a fundamental truth: real data is precious and limited. We can't\n","afford to waste hundreds of days on warmup periods or throw away data on extensive hyperparameter\n","searches.\n","\n","**The Environment: Unchanged Core, Different Context**\n","\n","The TradingEnvironment class is nearly identical to our synthetic version—same state construction,\n","same action projection, same reward function, same timing conventions. This is by design. The\n","environment defines the interaction protocol (MDP structure), which doesn't change just because\n","data sources change.\n","\n","However, the *interpretation* differs subtly. With synthetic data, we knew ground truth regime\n","probabilities and could verify our filtered estimates were reasonable. With real data, our regime\n","features are approximations of unknown truth. The RL agent must learn robust policies despite\n","this feature noise.\n","\n","Similarly, our liquidity proxy with synthetic data was a deterministic function of regime. With\n","real data, it's a noisy volume-based estimate. The agent experiences higher uncertainty about\n","transaction costs, which naturally encourages more conservative trading.\n","\n","**Baseline Strategies: Reality Check on Simple Rules**\n","\n","We run the same four baselines (cash, buy-and-hold, trend-following, myopic) on real data as on\n","synthetic. This parallel structure enables direct comparison: did the baselines perform similarly?\n","If trend-following dominated on synthetic data but failed on real data, what changed?\n","\n","The results are sobering. During the 2020-2024 period, simple trend-following strategies struggled.\n","The market exhibited multiple regime shifts, trending phases interrupted by sharp reversals, and\n","volatility clustering that punished static positioning rules. Buy-and-hold performed reasonably\n","(SPY rose over this period) but with substantial drawdowns (COVID crash, 2022 bear market).\n","\n","These baseline results calibrate our expectations for RL. If the expert policy (trend-following)\n","loses money out-of-sample, behavior cloning will learn to lose money in similar ways. Conservative\n","policy improvement might reduce losses through better risk management, but it can't conjure profits\n","from a failing base strategy.\n","\n","**Training on Real Data: The Overfitting Trap**\n","\n","Training RL policies on real data requires vigilance against overfitting. With only ~400 days of\n","training data, it's easy to learn patterns that don't generalize. Our two-stage approach (BC + CPI)\n","provides some protection:\n","\n","- **Behavior cloning** learns from demonstrated trajectories rather than directly optimizing\n","in-sample returns. This prevents the policy from exploiting spurious correlations (like \"returns\n","are always positive on Mondays in our training window\").\n","\n","- **Conservative policy improvement** penalizes deviation from BC, limiting the search space to\n","policies close to the demonstrated behavior. This prevents aggressive optimization that finds\n","apparent improvements that are actually overfitting artifacts.\n","\n","Even with these safeguards, we keep training short (100 BC epochs, 5 CPI steps) and use simple\n","linear policies. Complex nonlinear policies (deep networks) would certainly achieve better in-\n","sample fit, but they'd almost certainly overfit given our limited data.\n","\n","**Walk-Forward Evaluation: The Ultimate Test**\n","\n","The walk-forward evaluation on real data is where theory meets reality. We train on 400 days,\n","test on the next 100 days, then roll forward and repeat. This simulates realistic deployment:\n","train on all available history, trade live for a period, retrain with new data included.\n","\n","Our results show negative returns across baselines and RL policies in the first fold. This isn't\n","a failure of the evaluation methodology—it's the market telling us our strategies don't work in\n","this regime. The evaluation correctly identified this failure before we deployed real capital.\n","\n","This is the value of rigorous out-of-sample testing. In-sample, our policies might have looked\n","profitable by exploiting training-period quirks. Out-of-sample, these illusory edges evaporated.\n","Better to discover this in backtests than in production.\n","\n","**The Corrected Sharpe Ratio: Getting the Math Right**\n","\n","Our original implementation computed Sharpe ratio as `total_return / per_step_volatility`, which\n","created nonsensical values (Sharpe = -14 when the strategy lost 15%). The corrected version uses\n","`mean_return / std_return`, both computed on the same timescale (per-step).\n","\n","This correction matters beyond just getting numbers right. Sharpe ratio is the primary risk-\n","adjusted performance metric in finance. Getting it wrong invalidates all performance comparisons,\n","stress test interpretations, and investment decisions. The corrected implementation yields\n","realistic values (Sharpe = -0.2 to -0.7 for our losing strategies), which properly reflect poor\n","risk-adjusted returns.\n","\n","**Governance Artifacts: Production Readiness**\n","\n","Every artifact we generated for synthetic data—manifests, fingerprints, specifications, logs—\n","appears here for real data. This consistency is deliberate. Governance requirements don't change\n","based on data sources. Whether you're testing on synthetic data or deploying on real markets, you\n","need the same level of documentation, traceability, and auditability.\n","\n","The artifacts transform this from a research notebook into a production-ready system foundation.\n","Someone reviewing this code six months from now can understand exactly what was tested, on what\n","data, with what parameters, yielding what results—all without archaeological code excavation.\n","\n","**Conclusion: Bridging Research and Reality**\n","\n","This real-data implementation demonstrates that RL for trading is possible but not easy. The\n","algorithms work—they execute without errors, respect constraints, and generate plausible policies.\n","But working correctly doesn't guarantee profitable trading. Our strategies lost money out-of-\n","sample because simple trend-following doesn't work in all market regimes, and our conservative\n","offline RL approach can't discover fundamentally new profitable strategies.\n","\n","This negative result is valuable. It teaches humility about what RL can achieve with limited data\n","and simple features. It validates our governance approach—we detected the failure through proper\n","backtesting rather than learning it with real capital. And it provides a foundation for iteration:\n","now we can systematically improve features, try regime-dependent policies, or incorporate\n","alternative data sources, tracking improvements through the same rigorous evaluation pipeline.\n","\n","The path from synthetic data to real markets is traversable, but it requires engineering discipline,\n","statistical rigor, and honest assessment of results.

We began with a bold claim: RL offers a fundamentally different\n","approach to trading by optimizing sequential decisions rather than predicting individual outcomes.\n","Now, having built a complete system from scratch, we can assess what RL actually delivers—and\n","what it demands in return.\n","\n","**What We Built and Why It Matters**\n","\n","We constructed a minimal but complete RL trading system using only NumPy and Python's standard\n","library. This transparency was pedagogical by design—every algorithm, every calculation, every\n","design choice was explicit and inspectable. We implemented behavior cloning to learn from sensible\n","expert policies, conservative policy improvement to make cautious enhancements, and walk-forward\n","evaluation to test out-of-sample performance. We stress-tested under cost inflation, liquidity\n","shocks, and regime changes. We generated comprehensive governance artifacts: configuration\n","manifests, data fingerprints, environment specifications, decision logs, and reproducible bundles.\n","\n","This wasn't just an academic exercise. The system we built embodies production-grade design\n","principles: deterministic reproducibility through seed management, causality enforcement through\n","explicit timing conventions, constraint satisfaction through projection operators, and cost\n","awareness through realistic transaction modeling. These aren't optional refinements—they're\n","survival requirements. A system that ignores any of these will fail catastrophically when deployed\n","with real capital, regardless of how impressive its backtested returns appear.\n","\n","**The Performance Reality Check**\n","\n","Our results on real market data (SPY from 2020-2024) revealed uncomfortable truths. In the first\n","walk-forward fold, the trend-following baseline lost 15% with a Sharpe ratio around -0.7. The RL\n","policies—both behavior cloning and conservative policy improvement—performed similarly poorly,\n","losing 2-3% with Sharpe ratios around -0.2 to -0.3. None of the strategies made money in this\n","out-of-sample period.\n","\n","This is not a failure of the methodology—it's reality asserting itself. The 2020-2024 period\n","included extreme volatility (COVID crash), unprecedented monetary policy shifts, and regime changes\n","that our training data didn't adequately prepare us for. Our simple trend-following expert policy,\n","trained on one market regime, struggled when conditions changed. The RL policies learned to imitate\n","this struggling expert and made only marginal improvements through conservative policy optimization.\n","\n","This outcome teaches a crucial lesson: RL is not magic. It cannot extract profits from markets\n","that offer no exploitable patterns to the strategies it has learned. If your expert policy (the\n","behavior cloning source) doesn't work out-of-sample, your RL policy won't either—it's learning\n","to do what the expert does, not to discover entirely new profitable strategies from scratch.\n","\n","**What RL Actually Provides**\n","\n","Given these sobering results, what value does RL offer for trading? The answer lies in what it\n","optimizes and how it learns.\n","\n","First, RL naturally incorporates everything that matters for actual trading: transaction costs,\n","position constraints, risk penalties, and the delayed consequences of decisions. Traditional\n","supervised learning predicts returns; RL optimizes trading decisions accounting for the friction\n","and constraints of implementation. This cost-awareness is baked into the reward function, so the\n","agent automatically learns to avoid excessive turnover and to time trades when liquidity is better.\n","\n","Second, RL provides a framework for systematic improvement. Behavior cloning captures institutional\n","knowledge (the expert's strategy), while conservative policy improvement makes data-driven\n","refinements. This two-stage approach is much safer than trying to learn optimal policies from\n","scratch in the dangerous extrapolation regime where offline RL typically fails.\n","\n","Third, RL forces you to formalize your trading problem completely: What state information is\n","admissible? What actions are feasible? What outcomes do you actually care about? What constraints\n","must you respect? This formalization exercise alone—building the MDP specification—often reveals\n","unstated assumptions and hidden complexities that would otherwise cause silent failures in\n","production.\n","\n","**The Offline RL Challenge**\n","\n","Our demonstration of off-policy evaluation pitfalls crystallized a fundamental challenge: you\n","cannot reliably predict how a new policy will perform by analyzing data collected under a different\n","policy. Importance sampling weights explode when policies differ significantly, rendering estimates\n","useless. This is why we insisted on walk-forward backtests—actually running the policy in\n","simulated environments—rather than relying on clever statistical corrections.\n","\n","This limitation shapes what's possible with offline RL for trading. You're constrained to learning\n","policies that don't deviate too far from the behavior policy that generated your historical data.\n","Conservative policy improvement respects this constraint by penalizing deviation, but it also\n","means your improvements are bounded. You can refine and polish existing strategies, but you\n","can't discover radically different approaches through offline learning alone.\n","\n","Online RL—where the agent explores freely and learns from the consequences—could theoretically\n","overcome these limitations. But online learning in live markets is prohibitively expensive and\n","risky. You'd be experimenting with real capital, potentially losing substantial amounts while the\n","agent explores bad actions. For most trading applications, this is unacceptable.\n","\n","**Governance as Competitive Advantage**\n","\n","The governance artifacts we generated throughout this chapter—manifests, fingerprints, logs,\n","specifications, stress tests—might seem like bureaucratic overhead. They're not. They're the\n","difference between a research prototype and a deployable system.\n","\n","When a strategy loses money (as ours did), governance artifacts let you diagnose why. You can\n","trace every decision back to the exact state that triggered it, verify that no future information\n","leaked into those states, confirm that constraints were enforced, and check whether costs were\n","calculated correctly. Without this traceability, you're left guessing whether the loss was bad\n","luck, a bug, or a fundamental flaw in your approach.\n","\n","When regulators ask questions (and they will), governance artifacts provide answers. You can show\n","exactly what your system did, why it did it, what assumptions it made, and what risks you\n","considered. This documentation isn't about compliance theater—it's about demonstrating that you\n","operated responsibly and diligently.\n","\n","When you want to improve the strategy, governance artifacts tell you where to focus. Maybe stress\n","tests reveal excessive cost sensitivity—improve execution. Maybe regime analysis shows the strategy\n","fails in high-volatility periods—add regime detection. Maybe decision logs show constraint\n","violations—tighten the projection operator. Artifacts transform vague intuitions into concrete\n","action items.\n","\n","**Practical Recommendations for Practitioners**\n","\n","If you're considering RL for trading in your organization, here are hard-won lessons from this\n","implementation:\n","\n","**Start with strong baselines.** Your RL policy will only be as good as what it learns from. If\n","your expert policy (behavior cloning source) doesn't work out-of-sample, RL won't save you.\n","Invest in developing robust, cost-aware baselines before attempting RL.\n","\n","**Be conservative with offline learning.** The conservative policy improvement approach we\n","demonstrated is not optional caution—it's essential for avoiding the extrapolation errors that\n","plague offline RL. Small, cautious steps away from demonstrated behavior are much safer than\n","aggressive optimization.\n","\n","**Stress test relentlessly.** Our cost inflation and liquidity shock tests revealed that small\n","changes in assumptions can flip strategies from profitable to unprofitable. Test under 2-3×\n","normal costs, reduced liquidity, increased latency, and regime shifts. If your strategy only\n","works under ideal conditions, it doesn't work.\n","\n","**Respect causality absolutely.** Every feature in your state must use only data available before\n","the decision. One forward-looking feature—a smoothed estimate, a future-peeking indicator—can\n","make a worthless strategy look profitable in backtests while guaranteeing losses in production.\n","\n","**Invest in infrastructure.** The governance scaffolding we built—manifests, fingerprints, logs,\n","specifications—takes time to implement but pays dividends forever. It catches bugs during\n","development, enables debugging in production, and provides regulatory defense. Don't skip it.\n","\n","**The Path Forward**\n","\n","This chapter demonstrated RL for a single-asset, single-strategy problem with simple linear\n","policies. Real trading systems are vastly more complex: multiple assets, multiple strategies,\n","capital allocation across strategies, risk management overlays, regime detection, and portfolio\n","construction. Each layer adds complexity and new failure modes.\n","\n","Future chapters will build on this foundation, but the principles remain constant: formalize your\n","problem as an MDP, learn conservatively from demonstrated behavior, evaluate rigorously out-of-\n","sample, stress test comprehensively, and document everything for governance. RL is a powerful\n","tool for sequential decision-making under constraints, but it's not a shortcut around the hard\n","work of strategy development, risk management, and operational excellence.\n","\n","The negative returns we observed in our real-data evaluation are not the end of the story—they're\n","the beginning of the iterative improvement process. Now we know our simple trend-following approach\n","doesn't work on recent SPY data. Armed with decision logs, stress tests, and regime analysis, we\n","can diagnose why and hypothesize improvements: maybe we need regime-dependent policies, better\n","volatility forecasting, or different features in the state representation. Each iteration, informed\n","by governance artifacts, brings us closer to deployable performance.\n","\n","Reinforcement learning for trading is not about finding a magic algorithm that prints money. It's\n","about building systematic, auditable, improvable decision-making systems that respect the realities\n","of market microstructure, transaction costs, and risk constraints. When done rigorously—with\n","transparency, conservatism, and comprehensive governance—RL provides a principled framework for\n","this challenge. The framework we've built in this chapter gives you the foundation to tackle it."],"metadata":{"id":"b06alxBbLUWt"}}]}
