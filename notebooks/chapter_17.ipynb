In this notebook, we move beyond\n","signal generation and portfolio construction to tackle one of the most critical—and often\n","overlooked—components of systematic trading: **the overlay layer**.\n","\n","Think of your trading system as a two-stage process. In Chapter 16, you learned how to\n","construct a base portfolio using signals, alpha factors, and optimization techniques. That\n","portfolio represents your *view* on the market—which assets to own, in what direction, and\n","with what relative conviction. However, translating that view into actual position sizes\n","requires a second, equally important layer: one that governs *how much* capital to deploy,\n","*when* to pull back, and *what constraints* to enforce to keep your strategy safe and\n","operationally sound.\n","\n","This is the **overlay layer**—a collection of deterministic, time-aware state machines that\n","sit on top of your base portfolio and make real-time adjustments based on risk, market\n","conditions, and operational realities. These overlays act as guardrails, circuit breakers,\n","and adaptive scaling mechanisms that can mean the difference between a strategy that survives\n","market stress and one that blows up in the first crisis.\n","\n","**What You'll Learn**\n","\n","In this notebook, you'll implement five critical overlays that every institutional trading\n","desk uses in some form:\n","\n","**Volatility Targeting** adjusts your exposure dynamically to maintain a consistent level of\n","portfolio risk. When markets are calm, you can afford to take larger positions. When volatility\n","spikes, you scale back automatically—avoiding the classic mistake of being maximally exposed\n","at exactly the wrong time.\n","\n","**Drawdown Control** implements a sophisticated state machine that monitors your peak-to-trough\n","losses and progressively de-risks as drawdowns deepen. Rather than a simple stop-loss, you'll\n","build a system with cooldown periods, hysteresis bands, and gradual re-risking logic that\n","prevents whipsaw behavior during choppy markets.\n","\n","**Leverage and Exposure Caps** enforce hard limits on gross leverage, net exposure, and\n","single-name concentration—the kind of risk limits that keep you out of trouble with risk\n","managers, prime brokers, and regulators.\n","\n","**Turnover Limits** prevent your strategy from trading excessively, which not only saves on\n","transaction costs but also serves as an important operational safeguard against runaway\n","algorithms.\n","\n","**Kill Switch / Circuit Breaker** is your last line of defense—a system that monitors for\n","catastrophic losses, data quality issues, execution problems, and operational anomalies, then\n","automatically halts trading when things go wrong.\n","\n","**Why This Matters**\n","\n","Here's the uncomfortable truth: most academic papers and educational materials focus almost\n","exclusively on signal generation and portfolio optimization, treating position sizing as an\n","afterthought. But in live trading, the overlay layer is where strategies actually succeed or\n","fail. A mediocre signal with excellent risk management will outperform a brilliant signal\n","with poor sizing discipline every single time.\n","\n","This notebook is built around **governance-first principles**. Every decision is logged,\n","every state transition is recorded, and every artifact is saved to disk. You'll learn not\n","just to build overlays, but to build them the way professionals do: with causality tests,\n","deterministic execution, and full auditability. We enforce strict time-awareness—no\n","look-ahead bias, no data leakage—because overlays that backtest beautifully but fail in\n","production are worse than useless.\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to combine multiple risk overlays into a\n","coherent, production-ready system, and you'll know how to evaluate whether your overlays\n","actually add value or simply reduce exposure everywhere.

This isn't just good software engineering; it's essential\n","for governance, reproducibility, and institutional-grade risk management.\n","\n","**Why Configuration Registries Matter**\n","\n","In production trading systems, the ability to trace back *exactly* what parameters were\n","in effect during any given run is non-negotiable. Regulators ask questions. Risk committees\n","demand explanations. Post-mortems require precision. When your strategy loses money on\n","Tuesday, you need to know with certainty whether you were using a 60-day volatility window\n","or a 90-day window, whether your drawdown threshold was 5% or 7%, and whether your kill\n","switch was even enabled.\n","\n","The configuration registry solves this problem by creating a single, immutable record of\n","all decision parameters. Rather than scattering magic numbers throughout your code—a\n","0.10 here, a 252 there—you centralize everything in one dictionary that gets saved,\n","hashed, and version-stamped at the beginning of every run.\n","\n","**What Lives in the Config**\n","\n","The registry in Section 3 contains six major parameter groups:\n","\n","**Data Generation Parameters** control how we create our synthetic market data. You'll\n","specify the number of time periods (T=1000), the number of assets (N=20), and most\n","importantly, the regime characteristics. Our market has two states—low volatility (calm\n","markets with 1% daily vol and 30% correlation) and high volatility (stressed markets\n","with 3% daily vol and 70% correlation). We also define rare jump events that stress-test\n","our overlays and operational telemetry that simulates real-world data quality issues.\n","\n","**Base Portfolio Parameters** define how we construct our Chapter 16 placeholder portfolio.\n","We use a simple 20-day momentum signal with dollar-neutral constraints and optional\n","single-name caps. This isn't meant to be a sophisticated alpha model—it's a transparent,\n","causal baseline that lets us focus on the overlay behavior without conflating signal\n","quality with risk management effectiveness.\n","\n","**Volatility Targeting Parameters** control our adaptive exposure overlay. The target\n","annualized volatility is set to 10%, which might seem conservative but remember this\n","is *portfolio* volatility after diversification. We choose between rolling window or\n","EWMA estimators, set smoothing parameters to avoid whipsaw trades, and establish caps\n","(maximum 3x leverage) and floors (minimum 0.1x, never go completely flat unless other\n","overlays force it). These bounds prevent the overlay from making extreme bets based on\n","noisy volatility estimates.\n","\n","**Drawdown Control Parameters** define our state machine's behavior when losses mount.\n","We start de-risking at a 5% drawdown (D1 threshold), go completely flat at 15% (Dstop),\n","and impose a 20-day cooldown period before attempting to re-risk. The hysteresis band\n","(2%) prevents us from immediately ramping back up the moment drawdown improves by a\n","tiny amount—we want to see sustained improvement. The gradual re-risking step (10% at\n","a time) prevents us from going from zero to hero overnight.\n","\n","**Leverage and Exposure Caps** are your hard risk limits: maximum 2x gross leverage\n","(sum of absolute positions), maximum 1x net exposure (directional bet), and maximum\n","10% in any single name. These aren't optimized parameters—they're governance constraints\n","that reflect real-world requirements from prime brokers, regulators, or your firm's\n","risk policy.\n","\n","**Turnover Limits** cap daily portfolio turnover at 50% in \"hard\" mode, which scales\n","down trades to stay within the limit. This prevents excessive transaction costs and\n","serves as an operational safeguard against algorithms gone wild.\n","\n","**Kill Switch Parameters** define your circuit breaker triggers: 3% daily loss limit,\n","10% data missingness threshold, maximum 1000ms latency, and maximum 5% order reject\n","rate. When any trigger fires, the system freezes or halts based on the configured mode.\n","\n","**The Hash and Reproducibility**\n","\n","After defining all parameters, Section 3 does something crucial: it serializes the\n","entire config to JSON, computes a SHA256 hash, and saves both to disk. This hash becomes\n","your run's fingerprint. Change a single parameter—even from 0.05 to 0.051—and the hash\n","changes, creating an audit trail. Six months from now, when someone asks \"what were we\n","running in December?\", you can match the hash and recover the exact configuration.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**\n","\n","- **Centralization eliminates ambiguity**: All parameters in one place, no hunting through code\n","- **Hashing enables reproducibility**: Config hash + seed = deterministic outcomes\n","- **Saved artifacts create audit trails**: Regulators and risk committees love this\n","- **Separation of concerns**: Parameters are data, not code—easy to modify without touching logic\n","- **Professional standard**: This is how institutional desks actually operate"],"metadata":{"id":"RfbpkhPoQHK4"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###3.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"OS0i8sCTPcVO"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","# =============================================================================\n","# Cell 3 — Config Registry (Single Source of Truth)\n","# =============================================================================\n","\"\"\"\n","All parameters in one place.

The goal is to create a testing ground that's tough\n","enough to expose weaknesses in our overlays before real money is at stake.\n","\n","**Why Synthetic Data First**\n","\n","You might wonder why we don't jump straight to real market data from Yahoo Finance or\n","Bloomberg. The answer is control and pedagogy. With synthetic data, we can engineer\n","specific scenarios that stress-test our overlays: sharp volatility spikes, regime\n","transitions, data outages, execution problems. We know the ground truth, we can run\n","counterfactuals, and we can isolate exactly what our overlays are doing without the\n","confounding factors present in messy real-world data. Once you understand overlay behavior\n","in a controlled environment, adapting to real data becomes straightforward.\n","\n","**The Two-Regime Market Structure**\n","\n","Our synthetic market operates in two distinct states, modeled as a Markov chain. The\n","**low volatility regime** represents normal market conditions: daily returns averaging\n","0.05% with 1% standard deviation, and modest 30% cross-asset correlation. Markets spend\n","most of their time here—it's the regime where momentum strategies tend to work and\n","diversification provides meaningful protection.\n","\n","The **high volatility regime** represents market stress: returns turn slightly negative\n","(averaging -0.1%), volatility triples to 3% daily, and correlations surge to 70%. This\n","mimics what happens during financial crises when \"diversification disappears\" and\n","everything moves together. Our transition matrix keeps the market sticky in each regime—\n","95% probability of staying in low-vol, 90% probability of staying in high-vol once you\n","enter it. This creates realistic regime clustering rather than random regime-hopping\n","every day.\n","\n","**Correlation Dynamics That Matter**\n","\n","The correlation structure is crucial and often overlooked. In calm markets, assets\n","maintain some independence—your long tech position and short energy position actually\n","provide diversification. But when volatility spikes, correlations surge toward one.\n","Suddenly your carefully constructed portfolio acts like a single leveraged bet. This is\n","exactly when drawdown overlays need to kick in, and it's why we engineer this behavior\n","into our synthetic data. Your overlays need to handle markets where \"risk on / risk off\"\n","dominates and asset-level diversification evaporates.\n","\n","**Rare Jump Events**\n","\n","With 1% probability each period, we inject a jump event—a sudden 5-sigma move in returns.\n","These represent tail events: flash crashes, surprise policy announcements, geopolitical\n","shocks. In a 1000-period simulation, you'll typically see about 10 of these jumps. They\n","stress-test your drawdown controls and kill switch logic. Can your overlays respond fast\n","enough? Do they overreact and whipsaw? These jumps separate robust risk systems from\n","fragile ones.\n","\n","**Operational Telemetry Streams**\n","\n","Here's where Section 4 goes beyond typical academic exercises. Real trading isn't just\n","about market returns—it's about data quality, execution infrastructure, and operational\n","risk. We generate three operational telemetry streams:\n","\n","**Data missingness** simulates when market data feeds fail or become stale. In normal\n","conditions, only 0.1% of data points are missing. During stress regimes, this jumps to\n","5%—mimicking what happens when exchanges get overloaded or data vendors have issues.\n","Your kill switch needs to detect this.\n","\n","**Latency** measures how long it takes to get data and execute orders. Base latency is\n","50 milliseconds during normal times but can spike to 500ms during stress. When you're\n","trying to exit a position during a flash crash and your orders are taking half a second\n","to acknowledge, that's a problem your overlays must recognize.\n","\n","**Order reject rate** tracks how often your broker or exchange rejects your orders.\n","Normally under 0.1%, but during market chaos, this can hit 10% as exchanges implement\n","circuit breakers, credit limits tighten, or systems become overwhelmed. A rising reject\n","rate is an early warning signal that your execution assumptions are breaking down.\n","\n","**Determinism and Fingerprinting**\n","\n","Everything in Section 4 is deterministic given the master seed. Run the notebook twice\n","with the same config, get identical market data every time. We compute and save a data\n","fingerprint—summary statistics, regime counts, missingness rates—that serves as a\n","sanity check. This fingerprint becomes part of your governance trail.

Here, we deliberately keep it simple\n","and transparent—a basic cross-sectional momentum strategy—so we can focus on overlay\n","behavior without conflating signal quality with risk management effectiveness.\n","\n","**Why a Simple Placeholder Strategy**\n","\n","The temptation in educational materials is to showcase fancy alpha models with neural\n","networks, reinforcement learning, or complex factor combinations. We resist that temptation\n","for good pedagogical reasons. This notebook is about Chapter 17 (overlays), not Chapter 16\n","(signals). By using a trivially simple base strategy, we ensure that any interesting\n","behavior we observe—improved Sharpe ratios, reduced drawdowns, smoother equity curves—\n","comes from the overlays, not from a clever signal. If your overlays can make even a\n","mediocre momentum strategy safer and more consistent, imagine what they'll do for your\n","actual alpha models.\n","\n","**Cross-Sectional Momentum Logic**\n","\n","The strategy is straightforward: every period, we rank our 20 assets by their cumulative\n","return over the past 20 days. We go long the top third (roughly 7 assets) and short the\n","bottom third (roughly 7 assets), staying neutral on the middle third. This is pure\n","relative momentum—we're betting that recent winners continue outperforming recent losers,\n","a well-documented anomaly in finance. The strategy is inherently dollar-neutral (longs\n","offset shorts) and sector-agnostic in our synthetic world.\n","\n","**Causality is Non-Negotiable**\n","\n","Here's where Section 5 gets serious about time awareness. At time t, we compute weights\n","using only data up to time t-1. We look back at returns from t-20 through t-1, never\n","peeking at return[t] itself. This might seem obvious, but it's shockingly easy to\n","accidentally introduce look-ahead bias when vectorizing operations in numpy. That's why\n","Section 5 includes an explicit causality test: we perturb a future return (at t+10),\n","recompute the portfolio at time t, and assert that the weights haven't changed. If they\n","have, we've violated causality and the notebook stops with a clear error.\n","\n","**Normalization and Constraints**\n","\n","After ranking and assigning raw weights, we apply several normalization steps. First, we\n","enforce the dollar-neutral constraint by subtracting the mean weight, ensuring our net\n","exposure is zero at the base portfolio level. Second, we apply an optional single-name\n","cap (15% in our config) to prevent any individual position from dominating. Third, we\n","normalize gross exposure to exactly 1.0—meaning the sum of absolute values of all weights\n","equals one. This gives us a clean \"unit\" portfolio that our overlays can then scale up\n","or down based on market conditions.\n","\n","**What Gets Logged**\n","\n","Section 5 generates a construction manifest—a JSON document describing exactly how the\n","base portfolio was built. It records the strategy type (momentum), lookback period (20 days),\n","dollar-neutral setting (true), and any constraints applied. This manifest becomes part of\n","your governance trail. When your risk committee asks \"where do these positions come from?\",\n","you point them to this manifest rather than explaining code.\n","\n","**The Warm-Up Period**\n","\n","Notice that for the first 20 periods, our portfolio weights are all zeros. We don't have\n","enough history to compute 20-day returns yet. This is realistic—every strategy has a\n","warm-up period where you're accumulating data before you can trade. Rather than hiding\n","this or backfilling with assumptions, we're explicit: no positions until we have sufficient\n","history. This is another example of time-awareness and causal discipline.\n","\n","**Why This Isn't Chapter 16**\n","\n","You might notice we're not doing mean-variance optimization, Black-Litterman, risk parity,\n","or any of the sophisticated portfolio construction techniques from Chapter 16. That's\n","intentional. Those techniques address the question \"given my expected returns and risk\n","estimates, what portfolio should I hold?\" Chapter 17 addresses a different question:\n","\"given any portfolio recommendation, how should I size it and when should I override it?\"\n","The overlays we build in subsequent sections sit on top of whatever Chapter 16 gives us,\n","whether that's simple momentum or a complex ML-optimized portfolio.\n","\n","**The Separation of Concerns**\n","\n","This separation is crucial in production systems.

Get\n","volatility estimation wrong, and your overlays will systematically misfire: scaling up\n","into crashes, scaling down during recoveries. Get it right, and you have a robust\n","foundation for regime-aware position sizing.\n","\n","**Why Volatility Estimation Matters**\n","\n","Volatility is the heartbeat of financial markets. A portfolio that's perfectly sized for\n","1% daily volatility becomes dangerously overleveraged if volatility doubles to 2%.\n","Conversely, maintaining the same position size when volatility drops from 2% to 1% means\n","you're leaving money on the table—taking half the risk you could handle. Adaptive overlays\n","need real-time volatility estimates to make intelligent sizing decisions. But here's the\n","challenge: you need those estimates to be responsive enough to react to regime changes,\n","yet stable enough not to whipsaw on every random fluctuation.\n","\n","**Two Estimation Approaches**\n","\n","Section 6 provides two classic approaches to volatility estimation, each with different\n","tradeoffs. The **rolling window estimator** computes standard deviation over the most\n","recent N periods (60 days in our config). It's simple, intuitive, and doesn't require\n","parameter tuning beyond choosing the window length. The downside is that it treats all\n","observations in the window equally—a volatility spike 59 days ago carries the same weight\n","as yesterday's volatility, and when that old spike \"falls out\" of the 60-day window, your\n","estimate can jump discontinuously.\n","\n","The **EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) estimator** takes a different approach.\n","Instead of a fixed window, it uses exponential decay: recent observations get higher weight,\n","older observations gradually fade. The lambda parameter (0.94 in our config) controls the\n","decay rate—higher lambda means slower decay, more smoothing, less responsiveness. EWMA\n","estimates evolve continuously rather than jumping when old data drops out, making them\n","smoother for overlay decisions. RiskMetrics popularized this approach in the 1990s, and\n","it remains the industry standard for daily volatility updates.\n","\n","**Causality by Construction**\n","\n","Here's the critical design principle: at time t, our estimators can only use data through\n","time t-1. When we compute volatility at the start of day t to decide today's position\n","sizing, we haven't observed today's return yet. This seems obvious, but it's easy to mess\n","up in vectorized code. Section 6 makes causality impossible to violate by design—the\n","estimate function explicitly takes a time index t and internally slices the data to [:t],\n","never accessing [t] or beyond.\n","\n","**The Future Perturbation Test**\n","\n","To prove our estimators are causal, Section 6 includes a clever validation: we compute\n","the volatility estimate at time t, then we deliberately corrupt a future return (at t+10),\n","then we recompute the estimate at time t. If the estimate changes, we've violated causality—\n","our \"past\" estimate somehow depended on \"future\" data. The test uses assertions to halt\n","execution if this happens, making look-ahead bias impossible to accidentally introduce.\n","This is the kind of defensive programming that separates research code from production-ready\n","systems.\n","\n","**From Returns to Portfolio Volatility**\n","\n","Notice that our estimators operate on portfolio returns, not individual asset returns.\n","We first compute the portfolio return stream by dotting yesterday's weights with today's\n","asset returns: portfolio_return[t] = w[t-1] · r[t]. This is the return our actual position\n","would have experienced. We then estimate volatility of this portfolio return stream. This\n","is crucial because portfolio volatility (after diversification) is typically much lower\n","than individual asset volatility—a portfolio of 20 assets with 2% individual volatility\n","might have only 0.8% portfolio volatility if correlations are modest.\n","\n","**Initialization and Edge Cases**\n","\n","Both estimators need to handle cold-start scenarios gracefully. On day zero, we have no\n","history, so we return a small default value (1% daily vol) rather than crashing. For the\n","rolling estimator, if we haven't accumulated a full window yet, we use whatever history\n","we have. For EWMA, we initialize the variance with the first squared return and evolve\n","from there.

Here we implement\n","five distinct overlay systems, each designed as an explicit state machine with well-defined\n","states, transition rules, and event logging. These aren't simple scaling factors or\n","threshold checks—they're sophisticated control systems that monitor market conditions,\n","track internal state, emit decisions, and maintain complete audit trails. Understanding\n","state machines is essential because financial markets aren't stateless—your response to\n","a 5% drawdown depends critically on whether you just recovered from a 10% drawdown or\n","whether you're coming from all-time highs. Context matters, and state machines encode\n","that context explicitly.\n","\n","**Why State Machines for Risk Management**\n","\n","Traditional approaches to risk overlays often use simple rules: \"if volatility exceeds X,\n","reduce exposure by Y.\" These stateless rules seem clean but they create serious problems.\n","They can't implement cooldown periods, they can't prevent whipsawing between risk-on and\n","risk-off states, they can't gracefully re-risk after a crisis, and they can't maintain\n","the kind of hysteresis that prevents oscillation. State machines solve these problems by\n","maintaining memory—they track where you've been, not just where you are. A drawdown\n","overlay in COOLDOWN state will respond differently to new information than the same overlay\n","in RESTART state, even if current drawdown levels are identical. This path-dependence is\n","essential for robust risk management.\n","\n","**The State Machine Pattern**\n","\n","Each overlay in Section 7 follows a consistent architecture. It's implemented as a Python\n","dataclass containing state fields (current mode, tracked values, counters). It exposes a\n","step() method that takes current inputs (time t, market data, equity levels, telemetry)\n","and returns three things: an action or multiplier, an updated state object, and a list of\n","events. This disciplined structure makes overlays testable, composable, and auditable. You\n","can inspect state at any point, replay state transitions, and debug exactly why an overlay\n","made a particular decision at a particular time.\n","\n","**Overlay 1: Volatility Targeting - Adaptive Exposure**\n","\n","The volatility targeting overlay solves a fundamental problem: your base portfolio might\n","target a fixed notional size, but the risk of that notional varies wildly with market\n","conditions. A million-dollar position in a 1% volatility regime carries very different\n","risk than the same position in a 3% volatility regime. Volatility targeting maintains\n","constant portfolio risk by scaling positions inversely with estimated volatility.\n","\n","The overlay maintains state tracking the current multiplier (k_vol), the latest volatility\n","estimate (sigma_hat), and the raw pre-smoothing multiplier (k_raw). Each period, it calls\n","one of our volatility estimators from Section 6 to get a fresh estimate. If target\n","volatility is 10% annualized and current estimated volatility is 5%, we can afford to\n","double our positions (k_raw = 10% / 5% = 2.0). If estimated volatility spikes to 20%, we\n","need to halve our positions (k_raw = 10% / 20% = 0.5).\n","\n","But we don't apply k_raw directly—that would create whipsaw behavior as volatility\n","estimates bounce around. Instead, we first enforce caps and floors. The cap (3.0 in our\n","config) prevents us from leveraging up 10x during artificially calm periods or when\n","volatility estimates are unreliably low. The floor (0.1) prevents us from going completely\n","flat based on a volatility estimate alone—we reserve full risk-off for the drawdown\n","overlay. When these bounds bind, we log an event explaining exactly what happened.\n","\n","Then comes exponential smoothing. Rather than jumping from today's k_vol to the new\n","k_capped, we gradually blend: k_vol[t] = alpha × k_capped + (1-alpha) × k_vol[t-1], where\n","alpha depends on the smoothing half-life. With a 5-day half-life, it takes about a week\n","for the multiplier to fully respond to a regime change. This prevents trading costs from\n","exploding during noisy periods while still allowing meaningful adaptation when regimes\n","genuinely shift.\n","\n","**Overlay 2: Drawdown Control - The State Machine in Full Glory**\n","\n","The drawdown overlay is where state machine architecture really shines. It implements\n","five distinct states: ON, DERISK, COOLDOWN, OFF, and RESTART. Each state represents a\n","different regime of risk-taking, and transitions between states follow explicit rules\n","with hysteresis to prevent oscillation.\n","\n","In the **ON** state, we're at full risk as determined by other overlays (k_dd = 1.0).\n","We monitor current drawdown—the percentage decline from peak equity. If drawdown reaches\n","the first threshold D1 (5% in our config), we transition to DERISK. If we somehow jump\n","straight to the stop threshold Dstop (15%), we go immediately to OFF.\n","\n","In the **DERISK** state, we're in a controlled de-risking phase. The multiplier k_dd\n","scales linearly between 1.0 at drawdown D1 and 0.0 at drawdown Dstop. A 10% drawdown\n","(halfway between 5% and 15%) produces k_dd = 0.5. This creates a progressive response—\n","we don't panic and go to zero at the first sign of trouble, but we also don't stay fully\n","invested as losses mount. If drawdown improves back above D1, we return to ON. If it\n","deteriorates to Dstop, we transition to OFF.\n","\n","The **OFF** state means zero risk (k_dd = 0.0)—we've been stopped out and are flat. But\n","we don't immediately start looking to re-enter. Instead, we transition to COOLDOWN, which\n","lasts for a fixed number of periods (20 days in our config). This cooldown is psychologically\n","and practically important. It prevents us from getting stopped out, seeing a single good\n","day, jumping back in, and getting stopped out again in a whipsaw market. It forces a\n","pause for reflection and regime assessment.\n","\n","After **COOLDOWN** expires, we check if conditions have improved enough to justify\n","re-risking. Specifically, has drawdown decreased by at least the hysteresis band (2% in\n","our config) from the level where we stopped out? If yes, we transition to RESTART with\n","a small initial position (k_dd = 0.1). If no, we stay at OFF and wait. This hysteresis\n","prevents us from re-risking just because drawdown went from 15.0% to 14.9%—we want to see\n","meaningful improvement, like drawdown falling to 13%.\n","\n","In **RESTART** state, we're gradually ramping exposure back up. Each period, if drawdown\n","remains below D1, we increase k_dd by a fixed step (0.1, so we add 10% exposure per period).\n","After 10 good periods, we're back to full risk and transition to ON. But if drawdown\n","increases back above D1 during RESTART, we fall back to DERISK or OFF depending on\n","severity. This prevents us from racing back to full risk while the market is still\n","unstable.\n","\n","Every state transition generates an event that gets logged with timestamps, reason codes,\n","and relevant metrics. Six months later, when someone asks \"why were we flat on March 15?\",\n","you can trace through the state log and see: entered DERISK on March 3 at 6% drawdown,\n","transitioned to OFF on March 8 at 15% drawdown, started COOLDOWN, conditions didn't\n","improve enough during cooldown, stayed flat.\n","\n","**Overlay 3: Leverage Caps - Hard Risk Limits**\n","\n","The leverage caps overlay enforces three types of limits that are common in institutional\n","settings. **Gross leverage** (sum of absolute positions) is capped at 2.0, meaning if\n","you're 100% long and 100% short, you're at the limit. **Net exposure** (signed sum of\n","positions) is capped at 1.0, preventing excessive directional bets. **Single-name\n","concentration** is capped at 10% per asset, preventing blow-up from one position.\n","\n","The overlay receives proposed weights and systematically enforces constraints. First,\n","single-name caps: we clip each weight to [-0.10, +0.10]. Then gross cap: if sum of\n","absolute weights exceeds 2.0, we scale all weights down proportionally. Finally net cap:\n","if the absolute value of the sum exceeds 1.0, we scale down again. Each constraint\n","violation generates an event logging the severity of the violation and the scaling factor\n","applied. The overlay returns both a final multiplier (k_lev) and adjusted weights, giving\n","downstream code flexibility in how to apply the constraints.\n","\n","These aren't optimized parameters—they're governance requirements. Your prime broker\n","might require gross leverage below 3.0. Your risk committee might mandate net exposure\n","below 0.5. Regulators might impose concentration limits. The leverage overlay is where\n","these external requirements get encoded and enforced deterministically.\n","\n","**Overlay 4: Turnover Limiter - Controlling Transaction Costs**\n","\n","The turnover limiter addresses a different kind of risk: trading too much. Every trade\n","incurs costs (commissions, spreads, market impact), and excessive turnover can destroy\n","an otherwise profitable strategy. The limiter compares proposed target weights against\n","current holdings and computes total turnover: sum of absolute changes in weights.\n","\n","In \"hard\" mode, if turnover exceeds the maximum (50% in our config), the overlay scales\n","the trade down. Instead of moving from current weights to target weights in one step, we\n","move partway: final_weights = current + scale × (target - current), where scale is chosen\n","so turnover equals exactly the maximum. In \"soft\" mode, we allow the trade but log a\n","breach event. Hard mode guarantees cost control but might prevent you from reacting\n","quickly to opportunities. Soft mode allows flexibility but creates an audit trail of\n","when you exceeded normal trading activity.\n","\n","Turnover limits also serve as an operational safeguard. If your algorithm suddenly tries\n","to turn over the entire portfolio daily, something is probably wrong—a bug, a data error,\n","a misconfiguration. The turnover limiter acts as a sanity check that prevents runaway\n","trading even if other systems fail.\n","\n","**Overlay 5: Kill Switch - The Last Line of Defense**\n","\n","The kill switch monitors for conditions that indicate the strategy should not be trading\n","at all. It tracks four categories of triggers: catastrophic losses, data quality issues,\n","execution problems, and operational anomalies. If daily portfolio loss exceeds 3%, that's\n","a trigger. If more than 10% of market data is missing, that's a trigger. If execution\n","latency exceeds 1 second or order reject rates exceed 5%, those are triggers.\n","\n","The kill switch maintains state tracking its mode: NORMAL (trading allowed), FREEZE\n","(hold positions, no new trades), or HALT (flatten everything, stop trading). When any\n","trigger fires, it transitions from NORMAL to the configured halt mode and generates a\n","detailed incident report with trigger reasons, timestamps, and an authority field (AUTO\n","for automated triggers, MANUAL for human overrides in production systems).\n","\n","This isn't just about preventing losses—it's about preventing trading in degraded\n","conditions where your assumptions no longer hold. If your data feed is spotty, your\n","volatility estimates are garbage. If exchanges are rejecting 10% of orders, your execution\n","model is broken. If latency spikes to seconds, you can't implement intraday risk controls.\n","The kill switch recognizes these conditions and shuts down before they cascade into larger\n","problems.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**\n","\n","- **State machines encode memory**: Responses depend on context and history, not just current values\n","- **Explicit states prevent confusion**: You know exactly what mode each overlay is in at each moment\n","- **Events create audit trails**: Every decision, every transition, every constraint bind gets logged\n","- **Hysteresis prevents whipsaw**: Thresholds for entering and exiting states differ deliberately\n","- **Cooldown periods are essential**: Don't re-risk immediately after stopping out—let markets settle\n","- **Multiple failure modes**: Different triggers (market, operational, data) require different responses\n","- **Production-grade patterns**: This is how institutional risk systems actually work"],"metadata":{"id":"G1CWZPnoZVir"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###7.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"dyhLHnAjXarM"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","@dataclass\n","class VolTargetState:\n","    \"\"\"State for volatility targeting overlay.\"\"\"\n","    k_vol: float = 1.0  # Current multiplier\n","    sigma_hat: float = 0.01  # Current volatility estimate\n","    k_raw: float = 1.0  # Pre-smoothing multiplier\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class DrawdownState:\n","    \"\"\"State for drawdown overlay.\"\"\"\n","    mode: str = \"ON\"  # ON, DERISK, COOLDOWN, OFF, RESTART\n","    peak_equity: float = 1.0\n","    drawdown: float = 0.0\n","    k_dd: float = 1.0\n","    cooldown_counter: int = 0\n","    drawdown_at_stop: float = 0.0\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class LeverageState:\n","    \"\"\"State for leverage caps overlay.\"\"\"\n","    k_lev: float = 1.0\n","    binds_log: List[str] = None\n","\n","    def __post_init__(self):\n","        if self.binds_log is None:\n","            self.binds_log = []\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class TurnoverState:\n","    \"\"\"State for turnover limiter.\"\"\"\n","    prev_weights: np.ndarray = None\n","    breached: bool = False\n","\n","@dataclass\n","class KillSwitchState:\n","    \"\"\"State for kill switch.\"\"\"\n","    mode: str = \"NORMAL\"  # NORMAL, FREEZE, CANCEL_AND_FREEZE, UNWIND, HALT\n","    k_kill: float = 1.0\n","    trigger_time: Optional[int] = None\n","    trigger_reason: Optional[str] = None\n","\n","class VolTargetOverlay:\n","    \"\"\"Volatility targeting overlay.\"\"\"\n","\n","    def __init__(self, config: Dict):\n","        self.config = config\n","        self.target_sigma = config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"target_sigma_ann\"]\n","        self.estimator_type = config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"estimator\"]\n","        self.cap = config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"cap\"]\n","        self.floor = config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"floor\"]\n","        self.smoothing_hl = config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"smoothing_halflife\"]\n","        self.ann_factor = np.sqrt(config[\"evaluation\"][\"annualization_factor\"])\n","\n","        # Initialize estimator\n","        if self.estimator_type == \"rolling\":\n","            self.estimator = RollingVolEstimator(config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"rolling_window\"])\n","        else:\n","            self.estimator = EWMAVolEstimator(config[\"vol_targeting\"][\"ewma_lambda\"])\n","\n","        self.state = VolTargetState()\n","\n","    def step(self, t: int, portfolio_returns: np.ndarray) -> Tuple[float, VolTargetState, List[Dict]]:\n","        \"\"\"\n","        Step at time t.\n","\n","        Returns:\n","        -

Each overlay has its own view on appropriate position sizing—\n","volatility targeting wants to scale based on risk, drawdown control wants to reduce based\n","on losses, leverage caps want to enforce hard limits, turnover wants to constrain trading,\n","and the kill switch might want to shut everything down. These views can conflict, overlap,\n","or interact in complex ways. Section 8 establishes a clear priority ordering and\n","combination logic that ensures every possible scenario produces exactly one unambiguous\n","outcome.\n","\n","**Why Combination Logic is Critical**\n","\n","The naive approach would be to just multiply all the overlay multipliers together:\n","k_total = k_vol × k_dd × k_lev × k_to. This seems mathematically clean but it creates\n","serious problems. What if the kill switch wants to halt trading while volatility targeting\n","wants to 3x leverage? What if turnover limits say \"you can only move 20% toward your\n","target\" while leverage caps say \"you need to cut gross exposure by 50%\"? Without explicit\n","priority rules, you get ambiguous behavior that's impossible to audit or explain. In\n","production systems serving institutional capital, ambiguity is unacceptable. Every decision\n","must be deterministic, explainable, and traceable.\n","\n","**The Priority Hierarchy**\n","\n","Section 8 establishes a strict five-level priority ordering that mirrors how professional\n","trading desks actually think about risk:\n","\n","**Priority 1: Kill Switch (Dominant Override)**\n","\n","The kill switch always wins. If it says HALT, nothing else matters—we go to zero positions\n","regardless of what other overlays think. If it says FREEZE, we hold current positions and\n","make no new trades, again overriding everything else. This makes intuitive sense: if your\n","data feed is corrupted or you've hit a catastrophic loss limit, the correct response isn't\n","to carefully adjust your volatility scaling—it's to stop trading immediately. The kill\n","switch operates at a different logical level than other overlays. It's not optimizing\n","risk-adjusted returns; it's preventing disasters.\n","\n","The implementation is straightforward: we call the kill switch overlay first, before any\n","other calculations. If it returns HALT, we immediately return zero weights and stop\n","processing. If it returns FREEZE, we return current holdings unchanged. Only if it returns\n","ALLOW do we proceed to the other overlays. This creates an explicit short-circuit in the\n","logic—when the kill switch fires, no other overlay code even executes. This isn't just\n","efficient; it's conceptually correct. You're not \"combining\" the kill switch with other\n","overlays; you're giving it veto power.\n","\n","**Priority 2: Drawdown Control (Risk Regime Setter)**\n","\n","If the kill switch allows trading, the drawdown overlay sets the overall risk regime.\n","It produces a multiplier k_dd that ranges from 1.0 (full risk) through gradations of\n","de-risking (0.5, 0.3) down to 0.0 (completely flat). This multiplier represents a\n","fundamental judgment about whether current market conditions and portfolio performance\n","warrant taking risk at all. If you're in a deep drawdown, it doesn't matter what volatility\n","is doing—you need to reduce exposure or stop entirely.\n","\n","The drawdown multiplier acts as a \"ceiling\" on total exposure. Even if every other overlay\n","says \"lever up to 3x,\" if drawdown control says k_dd = 0.5, you're capped at 0.5x. This\n","reflects real-world risk management philosophy: you can't volatility-target your way out\n","of a severe drawdown. Sometimes you need to acknowledge that the strategy is out of sync\n","with markets and step back.\n","\n","**Priority 3: Volatility Targeting (Adaptive Scaling)**\n","\n","With the kill switch allowing trading and drawdown control setting the risk regime,\n","volatility targeting fine-tunes exposure based on current market volatility. It produces\n","k_vol, which scales positions to maintain constant portfolio risk. This multiplier can\n","be above 1.0 (lever up in calm markets) or below 1.0 (de-lever in volatile markets),\n","subject to its own caps and floors.\n","\n","At this point, we compute our first composite multiplier: k_composite = k_dd × k_vol.\n","This represents the \"desired\" exposure level after accounting for both drawdown state\n","and volatility regime. If k_dd = 0.5 (we're in mild drawdown) and k_vol = 2.0 (volatility\n","is low), we get k_composite = 1.0. If k_dd = 1.0 (no drawdown) but k_vol = 0.5 (high\n","volatility), we also get k_composite = 0.5. The multiplicative combination naturally\n","handles the interaction: both overlays can reduce risk, but you can't overcome a drawdown\n","de-risk by leveraging up on volatility.\n","\n","We apply k_composite to our base portfolio weights: w_proposed = k_composite × w0[t].\n","These are our \"proposed\" target weights before hard constraints.\n","\n","**Priority 4: Leverage Caps (Hard Constraint Enforcement)**\n","\n","Now we enforce non-negotiable constraints. The leverage caps overlay takes w_proposed\n","and checks three limits: single-name caps (no position bigger than 10% in absolute value),\n","gross leverage cap (sum of absolute positions ≤ 2.0), and net exposure cap (absolute\n","value of sum ≤ 1.0). If any constraint is violated, weights get scaled down or clipped.\n","\n","This isn't about optimization or risk targeting—it's about compliance. Your prime broker\n","won't let you exceed gross leverage of 2.0. Your risk committee mandates net exposure\n","below 1.0. These constraints are absolute regardless of what your overlays think is\n","optimal. The leverage overlay returns both a scaling factor k_lev and adjusted weights\n","w_adjusted. The scaling factor gets logged so you can track how often leverage caps are\n","binding (frequent binding suggests your base portfolio or multipliers are systematically\n","too aggressive).\n","\n","**Priority 5: Turnover Limiter (Cost Control and Sanity Check)**\n","\n","Finally, we check if moving from current holdings to w_adjusted would violate turnover\n","limits. This is the last step because turnover depends on the actual trade you're trying\n","to execute, which isn't known until all other overlays have had their say. The turnover\n","limiter compares w_adjusted to current positions and computes total turnover.\n","\n","In \"hard\" mode, if turnover exceeds the limit (50%), the limiter scales the trade:\n","w_final = current + scale × (w_adjusted - current), where scale is chosen so turnover\n","equals exactly the maximum.

Think of it as a \"perfect execution\"\n","baseline that shows what your overlays accomplish before real-world execution frictions\n","enter the picture.\n","\n","**The Time-Step Simulation Loop**\n","\n","The simulator marches forward through time, one period at a time, maintaining three core\n","state variables: equity (your cumulative wealth), weights (your target portfolio positions),\n","and current holdings (what you actually own right now). At each time step t, the sequence\n","is: observe market returns, realize portfolio gain/loss from yesterday's holdings, compute\n","new target weights using the overlay combination logic from Section 8, execute the trade\n","from current holdings to targets, update equity accounting for returns and costs, and\n","advance to the next period.\n","\n","This structure mirrors real trading systems where you start each day holding positions\n","established yesterday, the market moves during the day (you can't change positions mid-day\n","in this simple model), and at day's end you rebalance to new targets. The critical timing\n","assumption is that positions held going into day t earn returns based on day t's market\n","moves, and any rebalancing happens after observing those returns. This is the standard\n","\"close-to-close\" execution assumption used in daily strategy backtests.\n","\n","**Lag Discipline and Execution Timing**\n","\n","Here's where many educational backtests go wrong: they compute target weights at time t\n","using information available at t, then assume those weights earned returns at t. That's\n","impossible—you can't trade on information until after you've observed it. Section 9\n","enforces strict lag discipline: portfolio_return[t] = dot(weights[t-1], returns[t]). The\n","weights held at the start of period t (which are the weights we computed at the end of\n","period t-1) determine what returns we experience during period t.\n","\n","This lag is automatic and unavoidable in real markets. When you run your model at market\n","close on Tuesday, you compute target weights based on Tuesday's closing prices. You\n","submit orders Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Those orders execute during Wednesday\n","(ideally at Wednesday's close in our simplified model). Your positions during Wednesday\n","earn Wednesday's returns. You can't earn returns on Wednesday using a model that hasn't\n","even seen Wednesday's data yet.\n","\n","The simulator includes an explicit assertion to verify this timing: it checks that\n","computing weights[t] never requires access to returns[t] or any future data. This is the\n","same causality discipline we enforced in base portfolio construction and risk estimation,\n","now applied to the execution layer.\n","\n","**Fill Model and Kill Switch Integration**\n","\n","When overlays make decisions, they might say \"go to zero positions\" (kill switch HALT)\n","or \"freeze current positions\" (kill switch FREEZE). The simulator respects these commands\n","through a minimal fill model. In HALT mode, we set target weights to zero and assume\n","perfect execution—we can always exit positions immediately. In FREEZE mode, target weights\n","equal current holdings, so there's no trade to execute and no turnover.\n","\n","This is admittedly optimistic. Real markets don't let you dump large positions\n","instantaneously without price impact, and in crisis scenarios when you most want to exit,\n","liquidity often disappears. But Chapter 17's scope is overlay logic, not execution realism.\n","By assuming perfect fills, we isolate overlay behavior. When you move to Chapter 18 and\n","add realistic execution costs, you'll be able to measure exactly how much those costs\n","degrade the overlay performance you're observing here.\n","\n","**Transaction Cost Placeholder**\n","\n","The simulator includes a tiny transaction cost model: 1 basis point (0.01%) per unit of\n","turnover. If you turn over 50% of your portfolio, you pay 0.05% × 0.01% = 0.005% of equity\n","in costs. This is clearly labeled as a \"toy model\" because realistic costs depend on\n","spreads, market impact, timing, order type, and market conditions—none of which we're\n","modeling here.\n","\n","Why include any cost model at all if it's unrealistic? Two reasons. First, it creates\n","a nonzero penalty for turnover, which makes the turnover limiter overlay actually matter.\n","Without costs, trading 50% daily and trading 1% daily look identical in the equity curve.\n","Second, it establishes the infrastructure for costs—the simulator tracks turnover, applies\n","a cost function, and subtracts from returns—making it trivial to swap in Chapter 18's\n","sophisticated cost models later.\n","\n","**Equity Evolution and Compounding**\n","\n","Each period, equity evolves as: equity[t] = equity[t-1] × (1 + portfolio_return[t] -\n","transaction_cost[t]). Notice this is multiplicative compounding, not additive. If you\n","make 1% today and 1% tomorrow, your equity goes from 1.00 to 1.01 to 1.0201, not 1.02.\n","This matters enormously over 1000 periods. The difference between arithmetic and geometric\n","compounding is the difference between linear and exponential growth.\n","\n","We track the full equity time series in an array, which becomes the input for all our\n","evaluation metrics: drawdown calculations (compare current equity to historical peak),\n","return statistics (compute daily percentage changes), and ultimate performance (final\n","equity relative to starting value of 1.0).\n","\n","**State Trace Accumulation**\n","\n","As the simulator runs, it accumulates the complete state trace from Section 8's overlay\n","combination logic. Every period's trace dictionary—containing kill switch status, drawdown\n","state, volatility multiplier, leverage binds, turnover calculations—gets appended to a\n","list. By the end of simulation, you have a 1000-element list documenting every decision\n","the system made. This trace is crucial for understanding overlay behavior, debugging\n","unexpected outcomes, and generating governance artifacts.\n","\n","**Event Collection**\n","\n","Beyond state traces, the simulator collects discrete events: when volatility caps bind,\n","when drawdown transitions to DERISK mode, when leverage limits force position reduction,\n","when turnover limits engage, when kill switches trigger. These events are timestamped and\n","categorized, making it easy to answer questions like \"how many times did we hit the\n","leverage cap?\" or \"when did the kill switch activate and why?\"\n","\n","**Determinism and Reproducibility**\n","\n","Given the same market returns, base portfolio weights, and overlay configuration, the\n","simulator produces exactly the same equity curve, state trace, and event log every time.\n","There's no randomness in execution, no simulation noise, no Monte Carlo sampling. This\n","determinism is essential because overlay testing requires controlled experiments—you want\n","to change one parameter or one overlay setting and see exactly how outcomes change, without\n","confounding variation from execution randomness.\n","\n","**What This Simulator Doesn't Do**\n","\n","Section 9 deliberately omits several features you'd find in production backtesting engines:\n","intraday execution timing, partial fills, execution slippage based on order size, market\n","impact that moves prices against you, overnight gap risk, borrowing costs for short\n","positions, margin requirements, financing rates, and realistic spread models.

This isn't about maximizing Sharpe ratios or hitting arbitrary performance\n","targets—it's about measuring the specific behaviors that overlays are designed to control:\n","drawdown magnitude and duration, tail risk, turnover patterns, and the frequency with which\n","risk constraints bind. These metrics are overlay-relevant, meaning they directly illuminate\n","whether your risk management system is doing its job or just adding complexity without\n","benefit.\n","\n","**Why Standard Metrics Miss the Point**\n","\n","Traditional performance metrics—total return, Sharpe ratio, even maximum drawdown in\n","isolation—tell incomplete stories when evaluating overlay systems. You might see improved\n","Sharpe and conclude your overlays are working, when actually they're just scaling down\n","exposure everywhere, turning an aggressive strategy into a conservative one without adding\n","any adaptive intelligence. Or you might see slightly lower returns and abandon effective\n","risk controls that would save you during the next crisis.\n","\n","Overlay-specific metrics cut through this ambiguity. They measure tail risk management\n","(worst single-day loss, percentile analysis), drawdown dynamics (not just max drawdown\n","but how long you stayed underwater and how the overlay responded), operational behavior\n","(turnover distribution, constraint bind frequencies), and state transitions (percentage\n","of time in various risk regimes). These metrics answer the right questions: Did overlays\n","protect when they should? Did they avoid overreacting to noise? Did they create excessive\n","costs through whipsaw behavior?\n","\n","**Drawdown Magnitude and Duration**\n","\n","Maximum drawdown is the standard metric—the largest peak-to-trough decline in equity.\n","Section 11 computes this by tracking the running maximum equity (your peak wealth so far)\n","and measuring how far current equity has fallen below that peak. A 12% max drawdown means\n","at the worst point, you were down 12% from your high-water mark.\n","\n","But max drawdown magnitude only tells half the story. Duration matters enormously. Would\n","you rather have a 15% drawdown that recovers in three weeks, or a 10% drawdown that lasts\n","six months? The psychological and business impact differs dramatically. Section 11\n","computes drawdown duration statistics by identifying every period where equity is below\n","its peak (you're \"underwater\"), tracking continuous underwater stretches, and recording\n","their lengths. You get average drawdown duration, maximum duration, and the distribution\n","of underwater periods.\n","\n","These duration metrics reveal overlay effectiveness in ways magnitude alone cannot. A\n","well-designed drawdown overlay doesn't just limit how far you fall—it helps you recover\n","faster by preventing you from fighting regime changes. If your average drawdown duration\n","is much shorter with overlays than without, that's evidence they're helping you exit bad\n","regimes and re-enter when conditions improve.\n","\n","**Tail Risk Analysis**\n","\n","The worst single-day loss is your most extreme daily return—the day that hurt the most.\n","This metric is critical because many overlay systems (especially kill switches and\n","drawdown controls) are explicitly designed to prevent catastrophic single-day events. If\n","your worst day went from -5% without overlays to -2% with overlays, that's meaningful\n","protection, even if average returns barely changed.\n","\n","Section 11 goes beyond worst-case by computing return percentiles. The 1st percentile\n","(worse than 99% of days) and 5th percentile (worse than 95% of days) show tail behavior\n","comprehensively. The 95th and 99th percentiles show upside tail. Together, these paint a\n","picture of the entire return distribution, revealing whether overlays are just cutting\n","tails symmetrically (reducing all volatility) or asymmetrically protecting downside while\n","preserving upside.\n","\n","In well-designed systems, you expect asymmetric tail protection: the 1st percentile\n","improves more than the 99th percentile deteriorates. Your bad days get less bad, but your\n","great days don't disappear entirely. This is the holy grail of risk management—protection\n","without castration.\n","\n","**Turnover Distribution**\n","\n","Daily turnover (sum of absolute weight changes) directly drives transaction costs. Section\n","11 computes turnover statistics: mean daily turnover, standard deviation of turnover,\n","maximum single-day turnover, and the count of high-turnover days (exceeding your configured\n","limit). These metrics reveal whether your overlays are creating stable, low-churn positions\n","or frantically trading in response to every market wiggle.\n","\n","High average turnover with low standard deviation suggests steady rebalancing—possibly\n","acceptable if returns justify it. Low average turnover with high standard deviation\n","suggests occasional bursts of frantic trading—often a red flag indicating instability or\n","regime-transition whipsaws. The number of days exceeding turnover limits tells you whether\n","your limit is binding meaningfully (good—it's preventing excess trading) or constantly\n","violated (bad—it's set unrealistically tight or your overlays are broken).\n","\n","**Multiplier Statistics**\n","\n","Section 11 computes summary statistics on the total overlay multiplier k_total (the\n","product of drawdown, volatility, and kill switch multipliers). The mean k_total reveals\n","your average exposure level. If k_total averages 0.5, your overlays are running at half\n","the base portfolio's exposure on average. This context is critical for the counterfactual\n","experiments in Section 12—you need to know whether improved metrics come from intelligent\n","adaptation or just running smaller positions.\n","\n","The standard deviation of k_total shows adaptation volatility. Very low std suggests\n","overlays rarely change exposure (possibly too sluggish to adapt to regime changes). Very\n","high std suggests constant adjustment (possibly overreacting to noise and generating\n","excess turnover). There's a sweet spot where k_total varies meaningfully with regime\n","changes but doesn't chase every daily fluctuation.\n","\n","**Constraint Bind Frequencies**\n","\n","How often did volatility targeting hit its cap (prevented from leveraging beyond 3x)? How\n","often did it hit its floor (prevented from going below 0.1x)? How much time did you spend\n","in drawdown risk-off states (DERISK, OFF, COOLDOWN)? Section 11 counts these events from\n","the state trace, expressing them as percentages of total periods.\n","\n","Frequent cap-binding suggests your volatility estimator is systematically low or your\n","target vol is too aggressive—you're constantly wanting to lever up but being constrained.\n","Frequent floor-binding suggests the opposite: volatility estimates are consistently high\n","or target is too conservative. Large amounts of time in risk-off states indicate either\n","a poorly performing strategy (constantly in drawdown) or overly sensitive drawdown\n","thresholds (triggering too easily).\n","\n","These frequencies are diagnostic. They don't tell you whether performance is good or bad,\n","but they tell you what's happening mechanically in your overlay system, which is essential\n","for tuning and debugging.\n","\n","**Sharpe Ratio as Context**\n","\n","Section 11 includes approximate Sharpe ratio (mean return / std return × √252) not as the\n","primary metric but as context for comparing scenarios. Sharpe is useful for relative\n","comparisons: did adding overlays improve risk-adjusted returns compared to the base\n","strategy? But it's insufficient alone because it treats upside and downside volatility\n","symmetrically, which overlays explicitly don't.\n","\n","**Final Equity and Total Return**\n","\n","The simplest metrics—where did you end up? Starting from equity of 1.0, what's your final\n","value? Total return is just (final_equity - 1.0). These are necessary for grounding the\n","analysis. All the sophisticated tail metrics and drawdown statistics ultimately need to\n","be weighed against \"did I make or lose money?\" A system with perfect risk metrics but\n","consistent losses is academic; a system with mediocre risk metrics but strong returns might\n","be worth the volatility.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**\n","\n","- **Overlay-specific metrics matter**: Measure what overlays are designed to control\n","- **Duration is as important as magnitude**: How long underwater reveals regime adaptation\n","- **Tail analysis beats averages**: Overlays should protect extreme outcomes asymmetrically\n","- **Turnover reveals stability**: Constant trading suggests broken overlays or whipsaw\n","- **Multiplier statistics provide context**: Know if improvements come from delevering or adapting\n","- **Bind frequencies are diagnostic**: Show what's mechanically happening in your system\n","- **Sharpe is context, not gospel**: Risk-adjusted returns matter but don't tell the whole story"],"metadata":{"id":"c36JIW6xwD7e"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["###11.2.CODE AND IMPLEMENTATION"],"metadata":{"id":"EQ-SsykBwEzG"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","\n","def compute_metrics(equity: np.ndarray, weights: np.ndarray, state_trace: List[Dict], config: Dict) -> Dict:\n","    \"\"\"Compute evaluation metrics.\"\"\"\n","\n","    T = len(equity)\n","    returns = np.diff(equity) / equity[:-1]\n","    returns = np.concatenate([[0], returns])  # Align with equity\n","\n","    # Max drawdown\n","    peak = np.maximum.accumulate(equity)\n","    drawdown = (peak -

What if you\n","had just run the strategy at 50% scale the entire time—no overlays, no adaptation, just\n","constant half-size positions? You'd get lower drawdowns and smoother curves too, because\n","smaller positions mean smaller everything: smaller gains, smaller losses, smaller\n","volatility.\n","\n","The question isn't whether overlays reduce risk—of course they do if they reduce exposure.\n","The question is whether they reduce risk *intelligently*, scaling down when the strategy\n","is out of sync with markets and scaling up when conditions are favorable. That requires\n","comparing not just against \"no overlays\" but against \"constant scaling matched to your\n","average overlay exposure.\" This is the test most academic papers and industry presentations\n","fail to run, and it's exactly what Section 12 implements.\n","\n","**Scenario A: No Overlays (Pure Base Portfolio)**\n","\n","This is your unfiltered, unprotected strategy. We take the base portfolio weights w0[t]\n","from Section 5 and trade them directly with only minimal leverage caps to prevent\n","absurdity. No volatility targeting, no drawdown control, no turnover limits, no kill\n","switch. This scenario answers: what happens if you just trust your signal and size every\n","position identically regardless of market regime?\n","\n","Scenario A typically shows the highest volatility, largest drawdowns, and most extreme\n","daily swings. It might also show the highest returns if your signal is genuinely\n","profitable and you happened to avoid regime changes that killed it. Or it might show\n","catastrophic losses if you hit a bad regime at full size. The point isn't that Scenario A\n","is bad—it's that it provides the pure signal performance baseline against which overlays\n","are measured.\n","\n","**Scenario B: Volatility Targeting Only**\n","\n","This scenario isolates the pure volatility targeting effect. We enable the vol targeting\n","overlay but disable drawdown control, turnover limits, and kill switch. This tests whether\n","dynamically adjusting exposure to maintain constant portfolio volatility adds value beyond\n","the base strategy.\n","\n","Scenario B typically shows reduced drawdowns compared to A (because it scales down during\n","high-vol periods when losses often concentrate) and potentially improved Sharpe (because\n","it maintains more consistent risk levels). But it might underperform during sustained\n","trends in low-volatility regimes where it's leveraging up aggressively. The comparison\n","B vs A isolates the pure contribution of volatility-responsive scaling.\n","\n","**Scenario C: Full Stack (All Overlays)**\n","\n","This is your complete system—every overlay enabled, full priority ordering, the whole\n","Chapter 17 apparatus. Volatility targeting, drawdown control, leverage caps, turnover\n","limits, kill switch, all working together. This is what you'd actually trade in production\n","if you believed in the system.\n","\n","Scenario C typically shows the smoothest equity curve, most controlled drawdowns, and\n","best tail risk metrics. It might show lower total returns than A or B because risk\n","controls constrain upside as well as downside. The question is whether the risk reduction\n","is worth the return reduction—a judgment that depends on your utility function and risk\n","tolerance.\n","\n","**Scenario D: Constant Scaling Baseline (The Honesty Check)**\n","\n","Here's where Section 12 gets serious about intellectual honesty. We compute the average\n","total multiplier k_bar from Scenario C across the entire simulation. If C averaged k=1.5,\n","then D runs the base portfolio at constant 1.5x leverage the entire time. No adaptation,\n","no regime response, just steady 1.5x scale plus leverage caps to prevent constraint\n","violations.\n","\n","This scenario answers the critical question: are the benefits of Scenario C coming from\n","smart adaptation, or just from running at lower average exposure? If C beats D significantly,\n","you have evidence of genuine adaptive value—the overlays aren't just delevering, they're\n","timing that delevering intelligently. If C and D perform similarly, your overlays are\n","adding complexity without adding intelligence; you could achieve the same risk reduction\n","with a simple constant scale factor.\n","\n","Many practitioners skip this comparison because they're afraid of what it might reveal.\n","Section 12 runs it automatically, forcing you to confront whether your overlays actually\n","earn their complexity.\n","\n","**The Comparison Table**\n","\n","Section 12 prints a compact text table (no pandas, just formatted strings) comparing key\n","metrics across all four scenarios: final equity, total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown,\n","worst single-day loss, and average turnover. This table is structured for direct visual\n","comparison—you can immediately see which scenario wins on which dimension.\n","\n","The table format is deliberately simple and readable. Risk committees and portfolio\n","managers don't want to parse complex data structures; they want a clear summary showing\n","trade-offs. \"Scenario C has 11% drawdown vs 13% for no overlays, but also 20% lower\n","return. Compared to constant scaling at the same average exposure (D), C has similar\n","return but 15% better drawdown recovery time.\" That's actionable information.\n","\n","**Reading the Results**\n","\n","Strong overlay performance looks like: C significantly outperforms A on risk metrics\n","(drawdown, tail loss) while giving up modest returns, and C outperforms D on both risk\n","and returns (or at least on risk-adjusted metrics). This suggests overlays are providing\n","intelligent regime adaptation, not just dumb delevering.\n","\n","Weak overlay performance looks like: C barely improves on A, or C performs identically\n","to D despite much higher complexity. This suggests overlays are either misconfigured\n","(thresholds wrong, estimators broken) or the strategy simply doesn't benefit from adaptive\n","scaling (perhaps returns are too mean-reverting for vol targeting to help, or drawdowns\n","too sharp for progressive derisking).\n","\n","Perverse results look like: C underperforms D significantly. This means your adaptive\n","overlays are making systematically wrong decisions—scaling down at exactly the wrong\n","times, scaling up into trouble. This is diagnostic gold because it tells you something\n","is fundamentally broken in your overlay logic or parameter choices.\n","\n","**The Key Insight Statement**\n","\n","Section 12 prints an explicit interpretation after the table: \"Compare C (full stack) vs\n","D (constant scaling with same avg exposure). If C outperforms merely by reducing exposure,\n","D would show similar results. True overlay value shows up in regime-adaptive behavior\n","and risk control.\" This forces you to think correctly about what you're observing.\n","\n","**Saving the Comparison**\n","\n","All four scenarios and their metrics get saved to a JSON file for permanent record. This\n","becomes part of your governance trail—proof that you ran the honesty check, didn't just\n","cherry-pick the best-looking scenario, and documented the full range of outcomes.

It's not enough for overlays to work on\n","average across the entire simulation—they need to work in different market regimes, they\n","need to survive when individual components are removed, and they need to maintain\n","performance when parameters are frozen out-of-sample. This section implements regime-split\n","analysis, ablation studies, and parameter freeze demonstrations that separate robust\n","systems from those that only work under narrow conditions.\n","\n","**Why Robustness Testing Matters**\n","\n","A common failure mode in quantitative finance is building systems that work beautifully\n","in aggregate but catastrophically in specific scenarios. Your overlays might show excellent\n","metrics across 1000 days, but if they completely fail during the 100 high-volatility days\n","when you most need protection, they're worse than useless—they give false confidence. Or\n","perhaps your \"five-overlay system\" actually derives 95% of its benefit from one overlay,\n","with the other four adding complexity without contribution. Or maybe performance depends\n","critically on parameters that were optimized on the full sample and would fail if chosen\n","using only early data.\n","\n","Robustness testing exposes these weaknesses before you commit real capital. It's the\n","difference between a backtest that looks good and a system you'd actually trust with money.\n","\n","**Regime-Split Analysis**\n","\n","Section 13 leverages the two-regime structure from our synthetic data generator (low-vol\n","and high-vol states) to compute separate performance metrics for each regime. This\n","disaggregation is crucial because overlays are designed to respond to regime changes—if\n","they work identically in both regimes, they're not actually adapting.\n","\n","For each regime, we extract only the periods where that regime was active, compute returns\n","during those periods, and calculate regime-specific mean return, standard deviation, and\n","Sharpe ratio. We use Scenario C (full stack) for this analysis since it represents the\n","complete overlay system.\n","\n","What you want to see: different behavior in different regimes. Perhaps returns are lower\n","but more stable in high-vol regime (overlays successfully reduced risk), while returns\n","are higher with acceptable volatility in low-vol regime (overlays successfully allowed\n","scaling up). What you don't want to see: identical behavior in both regimes (overlays\n","aren't adapting) or perverse behavior (worse performance in high-vol regime despite\n","overlays supposedly protecting you).\n","\n","The regime split also reveals whether your volatility estimators and drawdown controls\n","are responding appropriately. If you spent 90% of time in drawdown risk-off states during\n","low-vol periods but stayed fully invested during high-vol periods, something is backwards\n","in your logic.\n","\n","**Ablation Study - Removing One Overlay at a Time**\n","\n","The ablation study answers a critical question: which overlays actually matter? We run\n","five additional scenarios, each with exactly one overlay disabled while keeping the other\n","four enabled. This creates a controlled experiment isolating each overlay's marginal\n","contribution.\n","\n","\"No Vol Targeting\" keeps drawdown control, leverage caps, turnover limits, and kill switch\n","but disables volatility targeting. Comparing this to the full stack reveals vol targeting's\n","contribution. If performance barely changes, vol targeting is adding little value—perhaps\n","your strategy doesn't benefit from volatility-responsive scaling, or your parameters are\n","misconfigured. If performance deteriorates substantially (higher drawdowns, worse tail\n","risk), vol targeting is pulling its weight.\n","\n","Similarly for the other overlays: \"No Drawdown\" tests whether drawdown control matters,\n","\"No Leverage Caps\" reveals whether you're frequently hitting limits that prevent blow-ups,\n","\"No Turnover Limit\" shows whether cost control is material, and \"No Kill Switch\"\n","demonstrates whether circuit breakers ever saved you.\n","\n","The ablation results print in a clean table showing final equity, max drawdown, and Sharpe\n","for each configuration. You can immediately see which overlay removal hurts most. In well-\n","designed systems, removing any single overlay should degrade performance, but the magnitude\n","varies. Perhaps removing drawdown control causes catastrophic deterioration (it's essential),\n","while removing turnover limits barely matters (your base strategy isn't that churny anyway).\n","\n","Ablation studies also reveal redundancy. If removing vol targeting has no effect when\n","drawdown control is present, perhaps they're both doing the same job—scaling down during\n","stress—and you could simplify by picking one. Conversely, if removing any overlay causes\n","disaster, you've built a system where all components are load-bearing, which might be\n","good (comprehensive protection) or bad (fragile interdependence).\n","\n","**Parameter Freeze Demonstration**\n","\n","The parameter freeze test addresses a subtle but critical concern: parameter selection\n","bias. If you chose overlay parameters (volatility windows, drawdown thresholds, leverage\n","caps) after looking at the full 1000-period simulation, you've implicitly optimized on\n","the full sample. Performance might be artificially inflated because parameters were tuned\n","to that specific data.\n","\n","The proper procedure is walk-forward testing: use only early data to select parameters,\n","freeze those choices, then evaluate on later unseen data. Section 13 demonstrates this by\n","splitting the simulation at 60% (period 600). In practice, you would estimate optimal\n","parameters using periods 1-600, freeze them, and evaluate on periods 601-1000. Performance\n","on the holdout period reveals whether your system generalizes or was overfit to the\n","calibration sample.\n","\n","Our notebook takes a shortcut for pedagogical clarity: we've already run the entire\n","simulation with fixed parameters defined in the config registry. So the \"freeze demo\" is\n","conceptual—we explain that parameters were fixed from the start, making the entire run\n","equivalent to out-of-sample testing. The governance artifacts (config hash, reproducibility\n","bundle) prove parameters weren't changed mid-stream.\n","\n","In production systems, you'd actually run the split: estimate vol window lengths on early\n","data, select drawdown thresholds based on early data distribution, then freeze and run on\n","late data. If performance collapses in the holdout period, your parameters were overfit.\n","If performance remains stable or improves, you have evidence of genuine robustness.\n","\n","**Interpreting Robustness Results**\n","\n","Strong robustness looks like: reasonable performance in both market regimes (perhaps\n","different in character but not catastrophically worse in either), all ablations showing\n","measurable degradation (every overlay contributes), and stable performance in parameter\n","freeze testing (no overfitting).\n","\n","Warning signs include: excellent performance in one regime but disaster in the other\n","(overlays might be overfitted to that regime), ablations showing one overlay does\n","everything while others are useless (complexity without benefit), or parameter freeze\n","causing performance collapse (severe overfitting).\n","\n","**Saving Robustness Results**\n","\n","All robustness findings—regime splits, ablation metrics, freeze test notes—get serialized\n","to a JSON artifact. This creates a permanent record that you ran these tests, not just\n","the happy-path scenario. When presenting results to stakeholders, you show not just \"it\n","works\" but \"it works across regimes, all components contribute, and parameters generalize.\"\n","\n","**The Pedagogical Value**\n","\n","Section 13 teaches a mindset as much as a technique. Professional quant researchers don't\n","just build models and measure performance—they actively try to break their models, expose\n","weaknesses, and find failure modes. Every test in Section 13 could reveal problems that\n","force redesign. That's the point. Better to find fragility in backtesting than in live\n","trading.\n","\n","Students often resist robustness testing because it's extra work and might show their\n","system isn't as good as they thought.

This instant visual confirmation ensures nothing was silently skipped due\n","to errors, permission issues, or bugs. The manifest includes eighteen distinct artifacts\n","spanning configuration files, data fingerprints, policy manifests, trace logs, test\n","reports, comparison results, robustness findings, plots, and reproducibility bundles.\n","\n","In production environments, this manifest becomes part of your post-run verification\n","protocol.

Six months later, when\n","someone asks \"do we have a causality test report for that December run?\", the manifest\n","tells them instantly: yes, it's in the artifact directory, here's the exact filename.\n","\n","**The Inspection Checklist**\n","\n","Following the manifest, Section 15 prints a prioritized \"What to Inspect\" guide directing\n","you to the most important artifacts for different purposes. If you want to verify no\n","look-ahead bias, read the causality test report. If you need to understand why the system\n","made specific decisions, examine the overlay state trace. If you're investigating constraint\n","violations, check the binds log. If you want to understand overlay contributions, read\n","the attribution report.\n","\n","This checklist is pedagogical gold for students. Rather than dumping eighteen files and\n","leaving you to figure out which matters, it provides a curated tour: \"Start here, then\n","look at this, then if you're interested in X, examine Y.\" It teaches not just how to\n","generate artifacts but how to use them for analysis, debugging, and communication.\n","\n","**What Chapter 17 Accomplished**\n","\n","Section 15 explicitly summarizes the chapter's scope: overlays for position sizing, risk\n","management, leverage control, turnover limitation, and circuit breakers. It emphasizes\n","that these systems sit on top of portfolio construction (Chapter 16's domain) and feed\n","into execution systems (Chapter 18's domain). This modular architecture is how professional\n","trading systems scale—different teams can work on different layers independently,\n","connected through clean interfaces.\n","\n","The summary also highlights what was deliberately simplified or deferred. Transaction\n","costs in Chapter 17 were toy placeholders (one basis point per turnover) explicitly\n","labeled as unrealistic. Fill models assumed perfect execution. Market microstructure was\n","ignored. These weren't oversights—they were conscious scope decisions to keep Chapter 17\n","focused on overlay logic without conflating it with execution complexity.\n","\n","**The Transition to Chapter 18**\n","\n","Section 15's final substantive content is a clear transition statement explaining what\n","Chapter 18 will cover and why it matters. While Chapter 17 treated transaction costs as\n","a small fixed percentage, Chapter 18 will model realistic costs that depend on order size,\n","market liquidity, execution timing, and trading style. While Chapter 17 assumed you could\n","always trade your target weights, Chapter 18 will address partial fills, adverse selection,\n","market impact, and execution uncertainty.\n","\n","The transition emphasizes that costs aren't just a minor drag on returns—they're a\n","first-class design constraint that should influence portfolio construction itself.\n","Cost-aware optimization might produce different base portfolios than cost-blind optimization.\n","Execution alpha (outperforming VWAP or arrival price benchmarks through smart order\n","routing) can be as valuable as signal alpha. Chapter 18 will show how to measure, model,\n","and minimize these costs.\n","\n","**Why This Matters for Practitioners**\n","\n","For MBA and Master of Finance students moving toward industry roles, understanding the\n","Chapter 17-to-18 transition is crucial. In job interviews, you'll be asked about risk\n","management frameworks (Chapter 17 material) and execution quality (Chapter 18). You need\n","to understand both that overlays protect strategies from blow-ups, and that poor execution\n","can destroy even well-protected strategies through death by a thousand cuts.\n","\n","The transition also manages expectations. Students sometimes finish Chapter 17, see decent\n","backtest results, and think they're ready to trade. Section 15 explicitly warns: not yet.\n","You've built risk controls, but you're still using unrealistic execution assumptions.\n","Chapter 18 will show how big realistic costs actually are (often shocking to students who\n","thought \"a few basis points\" was negligible) and how to build systems that remain profitable\n","after accounting for those costs.\n","\n","**The Real-Data Adapter Note**\n","\n","Section 15 briefly mentions the optional real-data adapter at the notebook's end. It's\n","currently disabled (USE_REAL_DATA=False) but can be enabled to show how synthetic data\n","would be replaced with actual market data from sources like yfinance. The section warns\n","that even with real data, Chapter 18's cost models are still needed—historical price data\n","alone doesn't tell you what execution would have actually cost.\n","\n","**Closing with Confidence**\n","\n","The final output confirms the run completed successfully, prints the Run ID one last time\n","for easy reference, and points to the artifacts directory. This clean ending creates\n","psychological closure—you've completed a significant educational module, generated\n","professional-grade artifacts, and understand both what you've learned and what comes next.\n","\n","**Key Takeaways**\n","\n","- **Artifact manifests verify completeness**: Confirm all promised deliverables were created\n","- **Inspection checklists guide analysis**: Know which artifacts answer which questions\n","- **Scope clarity prevents confusion**: Understand what this chapter did and didn't address\n","- **Transitions prepare for next steps**: Chapter 18 will add
