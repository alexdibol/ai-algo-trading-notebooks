Not in the sense of being fraudulent, but in being\n","**discontinuous and non-comparable across time**. A stock trading at 100 that\n","splits 2-for-1 suddenly trades at 50—not because value vanished, but because\n","the unit of account changed. A 2 dividend makes yesterday's 100 and today's\n"," 98 economically equivalent, but arithmetically different. Most amateur quants\n","ignore this, compute returns on raw prices, and discover their \"momentum strategy\"\n","is actually a long position in stocks that haven't split recently.\n","\n","Corporate actions are **economic non-events with accounting consequences**. A\n","split doesn't create or destroy value—it merely subdivides existing claims. A\n","dividend transfers cash from corporate to shareholder balance sheets. Yet both\n","create apparent price jumps that, if treated naively, generate false signals.\n","Your mean-reversion model sees a 50% overnight \"crash\" and buys aggressively,\n","not realizing it's chasing a split, not a bargain.\n","\n","We simulate two action types: **splits** (multiplicative adjustments) and\n","**dividends** (additive cash flows). Splits require backward adjustment—we\n","divide all pre-split prices by the split factor, making historical prices\n","comparable to current prices. Dividends require total return index (TRI)\n","construction—we reinvest the cash flow, tracking what an investor who held\n","through the dividend would actually earn.\n","\n","The normalization process creates **three price series**: px_raw (original\n","exchange prices, useful for limit order placement), px_adj (split-adjusted,\n","useful for technical analysis), and tri (total return including dividends,\n","useful for performance attribution). Each serves a different purpose. Trading\n","uses raw prices. Research uses adjusted prices. Performance measurement uses\n","total return. Conflating them creates systematic errors.\n","\n","We apply adjustments to **bid and ask prices** as well, maintaining spread\n","relationships. A split that divides prices by two must divide the spread by\n","two—otherwise your spread-based features exhibit false regime changes at every\n","corporate action. This attention to consistency is what separates robust\n","pipelines from fragile ones.\n","\n","Every normalization is **logged and hashed**. We store the corporate action\n","schedule explicitly—effective dates, event types, adjustment factors. This\n","creates an audit trail. If a price looks suspicious, you can trace it back\n","through the adjustment history to verify correctness.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Unadjusted prices are unusable for research but necessary for trading. Adjusted\n","prices enable comparison but obscure execution reality. Total return captures\n","economic truth but can't be traded.

The grid\n","defines our temporal resolution—we cannot make decisions faster than the grid\n","frequency, and we must align all asynchronous data to these regular intervals.\n","\n","The session calendar adds **non-trading periods**: weekends, holidays, market\n","closures.

A liquid stock might trade thousands of times per second—training\n","models on raw ticks is computationally prohibitive and statistically noisy. We\n","need **aggregation**: grouping ticks into bars (candles) that summarize price\n","action over fixed intervals. This transformation from irregular tick streams to\n","regular bars is called resampling, and doing it correctly is surprisingly subtle.\n","\n","OHLCV bars—Open, High, Low, Close, Volume—compress a sequence of trades into\n","five numbers. The **Open** is the first trade price in the interval, the **Close**\n","is the last, **High** is the maximum, **Low** is the minimum, and **Volume** is\n","the sum. These five numbers capture essential price dynamics: trend direction\n","(open vs close), range (high vs low), and activity level (volume). Technical\n","analysts build entire methodologies on these primitives.\n","\n","The critical decision is **interval closure**: which endpoint to include. We use\n","half-open intervals **(t_prev, t_curr]**—exclude the left boundary, include the\n","right. This ensures every tick belongs to exactly one bar and matches exchange\n","conventions. It also makes the semantics clear: the bar at time t contains all\n","trades that occurred after t-1 and up to and including t. This precision prevents\n","double-counting and gaps.\n","\n","Edge cases dominate resampling logic. What if no trades occurred in an interval?\n","We set **OHLC to NaN** (not zero, which would imply a price of zero) and volume\n","to zero. This distinction is crucial—missing data is different from zero data.\n","What if the first or last bar is partial? We handle it consistently with the\n","interval closure rule. What if prices are adjusted for corporate actions? We\n","apply splits and dividends **before** bar construction, so bars reflect normalized\n","prices.\n","\n","After construction, we **validate bar invariants**: high must be at least as\n","large as both open and close (you can't close above the high), low must be at\n","most as small as both (you can't close below the low), and volume must be\n","non-negative. These are mathematical necessities, not statistical properties.\n","If they're violated, the bar construction logic is broken, and we fail fast\n","with assertions rather than propagating corrupt data.\n","\n","We visualize the results—price bars overlaid with high/low markers, volume as\n","a histogram beneath. This sanity check catches obvious errors (prices spiking\n","to implausible values, volume suddenly zero) that might not trigger mathematical\n","invariants but clearly indicate problems.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Bar construction is not a lossy compression—it's a **deliberate information\n","filter**. You're choosing which tick-level details to preserve (extremes, endpoints)\n","and which to discard (intra-bar path). Wrong choices create aliasing artifacts\n","where high-frequency noise appears as low-frequency signal.

Causal Feature Engineering**\n","\n","We now enter the feature engineering layer, where raw aligned data transforms\n","into model inputs. This is where most pipelines leak the future into the past,\n","invalidating every downstream result. The error is insidious: a rolling mean that\n","includes the current bar looks innocuous—it's just one extra data point—but that\n","point represents information from the decision moment, not information available\n","before the decision. Use it, and your backtest becomes a fantasy.\n","\n","The distinction is **inclusive versus exclusive windows**. An inclusive window\n","at time t uses data from [t-w+1, t], including the current point. An exclusive\n","window uses [t-w, t-1], stopping before the current point. For features, we must\n","default to exclusive. The feature value at time t should depend only on data\n","available strictly before t. This is not pedantry—it's the difference between a\n","valid backtest and a forward-looking fiction.\n","\n","We implement three core rolling functions from first principles. **rolling_mean**\n","computes averages over trailing windows without importing any high-level library.\n","**rolling_std** computes standard deviations, enforcing a minimum of two\n","observations (you cannot compute variance from a single point). **rolling_corr**\n","computes correlations between two series, checking for constant data (zero\n","variance) that would make correlation undefined. All three use explicit loops\n","and index arithmetic—no magic, no hidden assumptions.\n","\n","The exclusive window choice has mathematical consequences. For a linear sequence\n","z_t = t and window size w, the rolling mean at time t equals t - (w+1)/2, not\n","t - w/2. This half-unit shift is **Test 1**: our mathematical verification that\n","the implementation matches the formula. We compute the rolling mean on z_t = t\n","and assert it matches the closed-form expression. If it doesn't, our window logic\n","is wrong.\n","\n","**Test 2** is the impulse leakage test. We create a zero series, inject a spike\n","at t=50, and verify the rolling mean at t=50 is zero (the spike doesn't affect\n","its own feature value) but the rolling mean at t=51 is positive (the spike now\n","enters the window). This proves temporal causality: future events cannot affect\n","past features.\n","\n","We compute several features to demonstrate the primitives: **returns** (1-step\n","and 5-step log returns), **rolling volatility** (standard deviation of returns),\n","**z-scores** (price deviations from rolling mean, scaled by rolling std), and\n","**rolling correlation** with a synthetic benchmark (the equally-weighted average\n","of all instruments). Each feature uses only past data, enforced by our exclusive\n","window convention.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Leakage is the silent killer of quantitative research.

This democratic weighting is simple but\n","naive—recent information is typically more relevant for prediction than ancient\n","history. Markets exhibit regime changes, correlation structures shift, and\n","volatility clusters. An equally-weighted window responds slowly to these changes,\n","dragging stale data into current estimates.\n","\n","**Exponentially weighted** (EW) features solve this by applying **geometric\n","decay**: recent observations receive exponentially higher weight than distant\n","ones. The decay parameter λ (lambda) controls how quickly weights diminish. For\n","λ = 0.95, today's observation is weighted 0.95 times yesterday's, which is\n","weighted 0.95 times the day before, and so on. This creates a half-life—the\n","number of periods required for a weight to drop to 50%.\n","\n","We convert the intuitive half-life parameter into λ using the formula λ = 0.5^(1/h),\n","where h is the half-life. For h=30 periods, λ ≈ 0.977. This lambda gives an\n","**effective window** of h/(1-λ), roughly 1300 periods in our case—much longer\n","than a rolling window of 30, but with most weight concentrated in recent data.\n","This is the key insight: EW features are long-memory with short attention spans.\n","\n","The implementation uses **recursion**, not explicit weighted sums. The exponentially\n","weighted moving average (EWMA) at time t is m_t = λ·m_{t-1} + (1-λ)·x_{t-1}.\n","Notice x_{t-1}, not x_t—we maintain the exclusive convention, using only past\n","data. Each new value updates the estimate by blending it with the previous\n","estimate, weighted by λ. This recursion is computationally efficient (O(n) instead\n","of O(n·w)) and numerically stable.\n","\n","We compute two EW features: **ew_mean** (exponentially weighted price) and\n","**ew_vol** (exponentially weighted volatility). The volatility uses EW variance,\n","computed as v_t = λ·v_{t-1} + (1-λ)·r_{t-1}², where r is the return. This assumes\n","zero mean, appropriate for returns. Taking the square root gives EW standard\n","deviation, comparable to rolling volatility but more responsive to volatility\n","clustering.\n","\n","The effective window of 1300+ periods might seem excessive, but remember: weights\n","decay geometrically. The most recent 30 periods contribute the majority of weight.\n","Old observations don't disappear—they fade gracefully. This makes EW features\n","**robust to missing data** (gaps simply extend the decay) and **adaptive to\n","regime changes** (new regimes quickly dominate the estimate without waiting for\n","old data to age out of a fixed window).\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Markets are non-stationary. A 20-day rolling window in January captures different\n","dynamics than the same window in March, yet treats them identically. Exponential\n","weighting **adapts the effective window to market conditions**—during calm periods,\n","the long memory stabilizes estimates; during volatile periods, recent data\n","dominates, enabling fast adaptation.

This is not a random collection of technical indicators copied\n","from blogs. It's a **systematic taxonomy** spanning seven feature families, each\n","capturing a distinct aspect of price dynamics, risk, liquidity, and market\n","structure.\n","\n","The first family is **return-based features**: simple log returns over multiple\n","horizons (1-bar, 5-bar, 20-bar). Returns are the fundamental unit of financial\n","analysis—prices are non-stationary, returns are closer to stationary. Multiple\n","horizons capture momentum at different timescales. Short-horizon returns detect\n","intraday trends. Long-horizon returns capture positional moves. Cumulative returns\n","measure total path traveled, useful for momentum and mean-reversion signals.\n","\n","The second family is **volatility and risk**: rolling standard deviation,\n","exponentially-weighted volatility, and downside deviation. These quantify uncertainty\n","and tail risk. Volatility clusters—high volatility predicts high volatility—so\n","recent volatility is a feature, not just a risk measure. Downside deviation\n","focuses on negative returns only, capturing left-tail behavior that standard\n","deviation treats symmetrically. Strategies care more about losing 3% than gaining\n","3%, and downside deviation reflects that asymmetry.\n","\n","The third family is **trend and momentum**: fast and slow moving averages, their\n","difference, and momentum scaled by volatility. Moving average crossovers are\n","classical technical signals—when fast MA crosses above slow MA, bullish momentum\n","may be building. Scaling momentum by volatility creates a **signal-to-noise ratio**:\n","a 2% move is more significant when volatility is 1% than when it's 5%. This\n","adjustment makes signals comparable across volatility regimes.\n","\n","The fourth family is **mean reversion**: z-scores measuring how many standard\n","deviations price deviates from its moving average. Mean reversion bets that\n","extreme deviations don't persist—prices \"snap back\" to the mean. The z-score\n","quantifies extremity: |z| > 2 is unusual, |z| > 3 is rare. These features work\n","best in range-bound markets and fail spectacularly during trending regimes,\n","illustrating why multi-family features are essential.\n","\n","The fifth family is **liquidity and volume**: relative volume (current volume /\n","average volume) and dollar volume (shares × price). High relative volume indicates\n","unusual activity—news, institutional flows, or liquidity events. Dollar volume\n","measures market depth in currency units, relevant for position sizing. A stock\n","trading 1M shares at 100 has different liquidity than one trading 1M shares at 1.\n","\n","The sixth family is **microstructure**: bid-ask spread in basis points and a\n","synthetic imbalance proxy. Spreads widen during stress, signaling illiquidity\n","and increased execution costs. In live trading, you'd compute imbalance from\n","order book depth. Here we synthesize it from volume and regime to demonstrate\n","the concept. Real implementations would use bid/ask sizes, trade aggressor flags,\n","and order flow toxicity metrics.\n","\n","The seventh family is **cross-asset features**: relative strength (price /\n","benchmark) and spread (log price - log benchmark). These capture whether an\n","instrument is outperforming or underperforming its peers. Relative strength\n","signals leadership and lagging behavior. Spread signals capture mean-reversion\n","in pairs or baskets. These features are essential for portfolio strategies where\n","absolute price is less important than relative positioning.\n","\n","Before stacking into X, we **validate array lengths**. Every feature must have\n","exactly n_bars elements. Length mismatches—caused by alignment errors, indexing\n","bugs, or truncation mistakes—create cryptic numpy errors. We check explicitly,\n","pad or truncate as needed, and log warnings. This defensive step catches bugs\n","before they become crashes.\n","\n","The final X matrix has shape (n_bars, n_features). We compute a **missingness\n","mask**: which entries are NaN. Missing data is expected—early bars have insufficient\n","history for large windows, some instruments might have gaps. The mask makes\n","missingness explicit rather than hidden. Models must handle it (impute, drop,\n","or mask loss), and tracking missingness helps diagnose data quality issues.\n","\n","We also create **feature metadata**: name, definition, window size, lag. This is\n","the foundation of \"Feature Cards\"—documentation for every feature explaining what\n","it computes, why it exists, and how it should be interpreted. Without metadata,\n","feature columns are anonymous numbers. With metadata, they're traceable artifacts\n","with provenance.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Random features create random strategies. Systematic feature families—returns,\n","risk, trend, reversion, liquidity, microstructure, cross-asset—span the space\n","of price behavior. This isn't exhaustive, but it's **structured**, ensuring you're\n","not just fitting noise in one regime that doesn't generalize.

Now comes\n","the step most researchers skip: **packaging the dataset as a versioned artifact**.\n","Without this, your experiment is unreproducible. Six months later, you won't\n","remember which features you used, what window sizes you chose, or which data\n","version you trained on. Your colleague can't replicate your results. Regulators\n","can't audit your process. You can't debug production failures because you don't\n","know what \"worked\" in research.\n","\n","Dataset packaging treats the feature-label pair as a **first-class deliverable**\n","with identity, lineage, and governance. Every packaged dataset gets a unique\n","snapshot_id—a deterministic hash of its metadata—that fingerprints the exact\n","configuration. Change one parameter, regenerate data, get a different snapshot_id.\n","This makes experiments comparable: two models trained on the same snapshot_id\n","used identical data; different snapshot_ids mean different data, and performance\n","differences might reflect data changes, not model improvements.\n","\n","The first packaging step is **chronological splitting**: train, validation, test.\n","Unlike random splits that scatter observations across time, chronological splits\n","respect temporal order. We train on early data, validate on middle data, test on\n","late data. This mimics production: you can't train on the future. We also apply\n","**embargoes** at boundaries—dropping samples equal to the label horizon. With a\n","20-bar forward return, we drop 20 bars between train and validation. This prevents\n","label overlap where train label at t=599 uses prices up to t=619, while validation\n","feature at t=600 uses prices up to t=599, creating information leakage through\n","the shared price at t=619.\n","\n","The second packaging step is **walk-forward splits**: sliding windows that\n","simulate rolling model retraining. We define train_length (e.g., 500 bars),\n","test_length (e.g., 100 bars), and step (e.g., 50 bars). Each split trains on\n","[start, start+500], tests on [start+500, start+600], then advances by 50 bars.\n","This creates multiple out-of-sample periods, each preceded by its own training\n","window. Walk-forward validation is closer to production reality than single\n","train/test splits—models are retrained periodically, not frozen forever.\n","\n","The third packaging step is **standardization with fit/apply discipline**. We\n","compute mean and standard deviation on the training set only, then apply them\n","to validation and test. This prevents leakage—test statistics don't influence\n","the normalization. We also hash the (mean, std, config) triple, creating a\n","transform_hash that fingerprints the preprocessing. Apply a different scaling\n","method, get a different hash, know immediately that results aren't comparable\n","to previous experiments.\n","\n","The snapshot metadata is a **comprehensive lineage record**: timestamp, config\n","dictionary, raw data hashes, curated data hashes, feature list with definitions,\n","label metadata, split definitions, transform hash, Python and numpy versions.\n","This document answers every \"what data did you use?\" question. It's not documentation\n","written after the fact—it's generated automatically by the pipeline, ensuring\n","accuracy and completeness.\n","\n","Finally, we compute the **snapshot_id**: a SHA256 hash of the canonical JSON\n","representation of the metadata. This single string uniquely identifies the dataset.\n","Store it in your experiment logs, model cards, and production configs. When a\n","model fails in production, check its snapshot_id. Regenerate that exact dataset.\n","Compare features. This is how you debug systematically rather than guessing.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","Science requires reproducibility. Finance requires auditability. Both demand\n","**versioned artifacts with deterministic identities**. A \"good result\" without\n","a snapshot_id is just a number—you can't verify it, reproduce it, or learn from\n","it.

Data quality is not a binary property\n","(good/bad) but a spectrum measured by quantitative KPIs: missingness rates,\n","outlier frequencies, temporal consistency, and distributional stability. Without\n","these metrics, you're flying blind. A subtle data corruption might degrade model\n","performance by 5%—enough to destroy profitability but not enough to trigger\n","obvious errors.\n","\n","We begin with **missingness per feature**: the fraction of NaN values in each\n","column. Some missingness is expected—early bars lack history for large rolling\n","windows, rare features like downside volatility are undefined when no negative\n","returns exist. But excessive missingness (>50%) suggests broken logic or misaligned\n","data. Per-feature missingness also informs modeling choices—should you impute,\n","drop, or mask? The decision depends on why data is missing, and missingness\n","statistics help answer that question.\n","\n","Next is **outlier detection**: count how many feature values exceed |z-score| > 5.\n","Outliers aren't necessarily errors—financial data has fat tails, and extreme\n","values occur. But outlier counts serve as anomaly detectors. If spread_bps\n","suddenly shows 500 outliers when it previously had 10, something broke—maybe a\n","corporate action wasn't applied, maybe a feed error created garbage prices.\n","Monitoring outlier rates catches these failures before they contaminate models.\n","\n","**Join lag statistics** from the alignment stage (Cell 6) measure how stale data\n","is when used for decisions. High lag means decisions rely on old information,\n","reducing signal quality. Monitoring lag over time detects infrastructure degradation—\n","if your feed latency increases from 50ms to 500ms, join lag grows, and strategy\n","performance degrades. This metric links data quality to system performance.\n","\n","The critical diagnostic is **distribution drift**: comparing feature statistics\n","across time windows. We split the data into early (first third) and late (last\n","third) windows, compute mean and variance for each feature, and measure changes.\n","Drift is inevitable—markets are non-stationary—but large drift indicates regime\n","changes that invalidate models trained on historical data. A feature with mean\n","shifting from 0.02 to 0.08 has fundamentally different behavior in late data,\n","and models trained on early data will mispredict late outcomes.\n","\n","We visualize drift as **bar charts**: early vs late means side by side, showing\n","which features shift most. This isn't just diagnostic—it's strategic intelligence.\n","Features with high drift need regime-aware modeling (train separate models per\n","regime) or adaptive techniques (online learning, rolling windows). Features with\n","stable distributions are safer for static models but might also be less informative\n","if they ignore regime changes.\n","\n","We also produce **three diagnostic plots**: price paths colored by regime (visual\n","confirmation that regimes exist and switch), rolling vs EW volatility (comparing\n","two estimation methods), and drift bar charts (quantifying distributional changes).\n","These plots are not decoration—they're **visual regression tests**. If regimes\n","don't switch, the synthetic data broke. If volatilities diverge wildly, the\n","calculation broke. If drift shows no variation, the windowing broke. Plots catch\n","failures that numeric tests miss.\n","\n","All plots save to the auto-detected output directory as PNG files. This enables\n","automated monitoring—run the pipeline, check for file existence, inspect plots\n","programmatically. In production, these plots become dashboards. Sudden missingness\n","spikes, outlier explosions, or drift accelerations trigger alerts. You don't\n","wait for model performance to degrade—you catch data quality issues before they\n","reach models.\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","\"Garbage in, garbage out\" is a cliché because it's true. But how do you detect\n","garbage before it's too late? Quality KPIs are your early-warning system. They\n","don't prevent all failures—sophisticated corruptions can evade simple statistics—\n","but they catch the majority of practical issues: feed errors, alignment bugs,\n","calculation mistakes, and distribution shifts. Monitoring quality is not optional\n","overhead—it's **the difference between a robust production system and a fragile\n","research

Completeness**\n","\n","The pipeline has executed: data generated, validated, normalized, aligned,\n","featurized, labeled, split, and standardized. But execution alone doesn't guarantee\n","correctness. The final cell is a **completeness audit**—systematically verifying\n","that every promised artifact exists, is well-formed, and is persisted to durable\n","storage. This is the difference between a script that runs and a system that\n","delivers.\n","\n","We begin with an **artifact checklist**: a dictionary mapping artifact names to\n","existence checks. Does RAW exist? Does CURATED exist? Does the feature matrix X\n","exist? Are labels computed? Is metadata populated? Are train/val/test indices\n","defined? Are standardization parameters fitted? Each check is a boolean assertion.\n","If any fails, we halt with an informative error rather than silently continuing\n","with incomplete state.\n","\n","The checklist serves three purposes. First, it's a **contract verification**—we\n","promised to produce these artifacts in the governance contract (Cell 1), and now\n","we prove we delivered. Second, it's a **debugging aid**—if an artifact is missing,\n","the checklist tells you exactly which one, not \"something broke somewhere.\" Third,\n","it's **living documentation**—the checklist enumerates all pipeline outputs,\n","making the system's API explicit.\n","\n","After verification, we **persist artifacts to disk**. The snapshot metadata saves\n","as JSON—human-readable, version-controllable, and parseable by any language. The\n","feature matrices (X_train, X_val, X_test) and label vectors (Y_train, Y_val,\n","Y_test) save as numpy .npy files—efficient binary format with deterministic\n","serialization. Standardization parameters (mu, sigma) also save as .npy. Four\n","plots save as PNGs. In total, 11 files land in the output directory.\n","\n","File saving uses the **auto-detected output directory** from Cell 2. In Google\n","Colab, that's /content. In local environments, it's the current directory. This\n","portability means the same code runs everywhere without path modifications. Each\n","save operation logs a confirmation message. If saving fails (disk full, permission\n","denied), the error is immediate and localized, not buried in later operations.\n","\n","We then perform **Test 5: feature re-computation**. We recompute one feature\n","(ret_1) from scratch and assert it matches the original. This verifies determinism—\n","running the same logic twice produces identical results. If this fails, the\n","pipeline has hidden randomness (unseeded random calls, floating-point non-determinism,\n","or OS-dependent behavior). Determinism is foundational for reproducibility.\n","\n","Finally, we run **Test 6: hash equality verification**. We hash X and Y, creating\n","fingerprints. We then recompute those hashes and assert equality. This is the\n","ultimate reproducibility check—not just that code runs without errors, but that\n","it produces **bit-identical outputs** across runs. Different hashes mean non-determinism,\n","which invalidates claims about model performance (maybe the \"good\" run got lucky\n","initialization, not genuinely better features).\n","\n","The cell concludes with a **summary report**: number of instruments, raw events,\n","bars, features, labels, snapshot_id, and a confirmation that all governance\n","contracts are satisfied. This summary is both a victory lap (the pipeline worked!)\n","and a permanent record (here's what we built). Copy this summary into experiment\n","logs, model cards, and documentation. It's the one-sentence answer to \"what data\n","did you use?\"\n","\n","WHY THIS MATTERS:\n","A pipeline that runs is not the same as a pipeline that succeeds. Execution\n","without verification is hope, not engineering.

This is not a tutorial on feature ideas or a\n","collection of recipes—it is a **complete system architecture** for transforming\n","raw market data into model-ready datasets with embedded governance, explicit\n","causality, and deterministic reproducibility.\n","\n","We implemented a **seven-stage pipeline**:\n","\n","1. **Ingest (RAW)**: Synthetic market generation with event_time and record_time,\n","   regime-switching dynamics, intraday seasonality, and bid-ask microstructure\n","2. **Validate**: Data contracts with schema invariants, mandatory field checks,\n","   and violation vs warning distinction\n","3. **Normalize (CURATED)**: Corporate action handling (splits and dividends),\n","   split-adjusted prices, and total return indices\n","4. **Align**: Temporal grid construction, session calendars, and causal as-of\n","   joins that respect information availability\n","5. **Featureize**: Rolling windows (exclusive, tested for leakage), exponential\n","   weighting (recursive, adaptive), and lag policies (publication delays)\n","6. **Label**: Forward returns with explicit entry conventions, barrier labels\n","   with tie-breaking rules, and rare-event indicators\n","7. **Package**: Chronological and walk-forward splits, standardization with\n","   fit/apply discipline, and versioned snapshot metadata\n","\n","Each stage produced **governance artifacts**: hashes for lineage tracking, metadata\n","for documentation, and quality KPIs for monitoring. We enforced causality at\n","every step, implemented six explicit tests (mathematical verification, impulse\n","leakage, causality checks, and determinism verification), and validated invariants\n","with assertions that fail fast rather than propagate corruption.\n","\n","\n","**What We Learned**\n","\n","The central lesson is that **data pipelines ARE the trading system**. Features\n","don't predict returns in isolation—they predict returns when constructed correctly,\n","aligned properly, and labeled carefully. A single mistake—including current bar\n","in rolling mean, using event_time when record_time matters, forgetting to adjust\n","for splits—invalidates everything downstream. Most \"alpha\" that disappears in\n","production is not alpha at all—it's pipeline leakage masquerading as signal.\n","\n","We learned that **causality is not automatic**. Time moves forward, but data\n","doesn't. Prices arrive late. Fundamentals publish with delays. Corporate actions\n","revise history. Explicit modeling of these realities—as-of joins, publication\n","delays, exclusive windows—is what separates backtests that work from backtests\n","that lie.\n","\n","We learned that **governance is not overhead**. Hashing, versioning, metadata,\n","and reproducibility checks feel bureaucratic when writing code. But when debugging\n","a production failure, tracking down which data version a model used, or responding\n","to a regulatory audit, governance artifacts become essential. They're not slowing\n","you down—they're enabling you to move fast without breaking things.\n","\n","We learned that **transparency beats convenience**. Pandas is convenient—one line\n","for rolling means, built-in date handling, magical resampling. But that magic\n","hides assumptions: how does it handle missing data? What's the window closure?\n","Where does it align timestamps? Our explicit numpy implementations are verbose\n","but transparent. Every decision is visible in code, testable with assertions,\n","and debuggable when wrong.\n","\n","We learned that **synthetic data is not a toy**. It's a controlled laboratory\n","where you know the ground truth. Did your volatility feature detect regime changes?\n","Check against the regime ground truth. Did your correlation feature capture\n","cross-asset relationships? Compare to the known covariance matrix. Synthetic data\n","lets you verify correctness before tackling real data's ambiguities.\n","\n","\n","**What Comes Next**\n","\n","This pipeline is a **foundation, not a ceiling**. Here's what to build on top:\n","\n","**More features**: We implemented 17 features across 7 families. Production systems\n","have hundreds—order flow toxicity, limit order book imbalances, option-implied\n","surfaces, news sentiment, macroeconomic surprises. The architecture handles them\n","all: generate, validate, align, compute with causality, package with metadata.\n","\n","**More labels**: We covered forward returns, barriers, and rare events. Add\n","classification labels (up/down/flat), quantile labels (top/bottom decile), and\n","ranking labels (relative performance). Each needs its own causality convention\n","and embargo policy, but the packaging infrastructure remains the same.\n","\n","**Real data adapters**: We worked with synthetic data. Adapting to real feeds\n","(APIs, FIX protocols, database dumps) means writing ingestion logic that converts\n","vendor formats into our canonical RAW structure. Once data is in RAW, the entire\n","pipeline reuses without modification—that's the power of clean abstractions.\n","\n","**Advanced splitting**: We used simple chronological and walk-forward splits.\n","Production needs cross-validation aware of time dependencies (blocked CV, purged\n","CV), stratified splits that balance label distributions, and adversarial splits\n","that stress-test robustness.\n","\n","**Feature selection and engineering**: We computed features manually. Automated\n","feature engineering (genetic programming, neural architecture search) generates\n","thousands of candidates. Feature selection (L1 regularization, mutual information,\n","SHAP values) identifies which matter. Both fit naturally into this pipeline—they\n","consume X and Y, produce selected features or engineered transforms, and package\n","results with metadata.\n","\n","**Model training integration**: This notebook stops at dataset packaging. The\n","next chapter trains models: linear models, tree ensembles, neural networks,\n","reinforcement learning. All consume the standardized X_train/Y_train arrays\n","we produced. The pipeline doesn't know what models you'll train—it just guarantees\n","the data is correct.\n","\n","\n","**Final Reflections**\n","\n","Most quantitative finance education focuses on models—sophisticated mathematics,\n","complex architectures, clever optimization. This notebook inverts that priority.\n","We spent 1,500 lines on data and zero lines on models, because **data quality\n","determines model quality**. The best neural network trained on leaky features\n","performs worse than logistic regression trained on causal features.\n","\n","The phrase \"garbage in, garbage out\" understates the problem. Garbage is obvious—\n","you can see it's wrong. The danger is **plausible garbage**: features that look\n","reasonable, pass sanity checks, and correlate with labels in backtest, but leak\n","the future or ignore reality in subtle ways. This pipeline defends against\n","plausible garbage with explicit contracts, tested causality, and transparent\n","implementations.\n","\n","If you remember one thing from this notebook, remember this: **pipelines are\n","not preprocessing—they are the system**. Every design choice (window closure,\n","alignment method, lag policy, entry convention) affects strategy behavior.\n","Treating pipelines as throwaway glue code is how research fails to productionize.\n","Treating them as first-class architecture is how you build strategies that survive\n","contact with reality.\n","\n","The code you saw is not \"production quality\" in the sense of being optimized,\n","parallelized, or enterprise-hardened. It's production quality in the sense of\n","being **correct, auditable, and reproducible**. Optimization comes later.\n","Correctness comes first. If your pipeline is wrong, nothing else matters.\n","\n","\n","**Governance Contract: Final Verification**\n","\n","Let's check our initial governance contract:\n","\n","✓ Deterministic seeds set and logged (Cell 2)  \n","✓ Raw data validated against schema invariants (Cell 4)  \n","✓ Corporate actions applied and logged (Cell 5)  \n","✓ Time-aware alignment with causal as-of joins (Cell 6)  \n","✓ Rolling features with NO leakage (Cell 8, Tests 1-2)  \n","✓ Labels constructed with explicit entry conventions (Cell 12)  \n","✓ All artifacts hashed and versioned (Cell 13)  \n","✓ Reproducibility verified (Cell 15, Tests 5-6)  \n","\n","**Contract fulfilled.
