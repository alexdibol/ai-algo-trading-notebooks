If the chapter is the “why” and the “what,” this notebook is the “how”—but in a very specific sense: **how to build a deep-learning forecasting pipeline that does not accidentally cheat**.\n","\n","That might sound like a strange emphasis. Shouldn’t the goal be to build the best model? In trading, “best” is meaningless unless you can answer three uncomfortable questions with a straight face:\n","\n","1) *Could this model have learned from the future without us noticing?*  \n","2) *If we rerun the experiment tomorrow, will we get the same result—or a completely different one?*  \n","3) *If performance changes across market conditions, do we understand where and why?*\n","\n","Deep learning makes these questions more urgent. Neural nets are powerful. They can learn nonlinear interactions, discover representations from windowed time series, and sometimes produce better ranking signals or more stable forecasts. But they are also exceptionally good at exploiting tiny mistakes: an off-by-one label shift, a normalization computed on the full dataset, a batch construction that quietly mixes time periods. Those “tiny” mistakes can generate “amazing” backtest results that evaporate the moment you try to replicate them or deploy them.\n","\n","So this notebook is designed with a single mission: **teach you how to do deep learning in trading without lying to yourself.** Not with slogans, but with mechanics you can inspect line by line.\n","\n","**What you will build (and what you will not)**\n","\n","You will build an end-to-end supervised learning system that predicts future returns (or direction) from past market information using a minimal neural network implemented from first principles. Concretely, you will:\n","\n","- Generate a synthetic market dataset with properties that make trading realistic: heavy tails, volatility clustering, drift changes, and nonstationarity.\n","- Turn time series into **windowed tensors**—the core data structure for deep models—so that each training example is a “block of recent history,” not a single row.\n","- Define labels carefully (future returns at a chosen horizon) and prove, with explicit checks, that your labels do not leak into your inputs.\n","- Train a small neural net using **NumPy only**, implementing forward pass, loss functions, backpropagation, and updates explicitly (no PyTorch/TensorFlow).\n","- Evaluate using **walk-forward validation** (rolling in time), including **embargo logic** to avoid subtle boundary contamination when labels overlap.\n","- Track metrics that practitioners actually care about: MSE, sign accuracy, Information Coefficient (IC), rank IC, and simple calibration diagnostics.\n","- Run sanity checks that act like “unit tests for honesty”: random labels, permuted features, and a normalization leakage canary.\n","\n","What you will **not** do here—on purpose—is the rest of the trading stack. There is no portfolio optimization, no position sizing, no transaction costs, and no execution simulation. Those belong later in the book. Here we stay within scope: **forecasting**, and the discipline required to make forecasting results credible.\n","\n","**Why synthetic data first**\n","\n","MBA and MFin students often ask: “Why not just download prices and train a model?” Because in practice, **real data adds ambiguity before you know what you’re doing**. Corporate actions, missing data, survivorship bias, vendor differences, timestamp conventions—these are all real and important, but if you begin there, you won’t know whether your results come from the model or from a data quirk.\n","\n","Synthetic data lets us do something pedagogically powerful: we control the environment. We can build a dataset with known properties and then test whether the pipeline behaves as expected. When we intentionally introduce leakage, performance should jump. When we randomize labels, performance should collapse. Those are not academic games—they are the fastest way to learn what honest modeling looks like.\n","\n","Once you can build a leakage-resistant pipeline on synthetic data, adding real data later becomes an engineering task rather than a conceptual gamble.\n","\n","**The core idea: time is a hard constraint**\n","\n","Most of what goes wrong in machine learning for markets is a misunderstanding of time. In finance, you do not have “examples.” You have a sequence. And a forecasting model is only valid if it obeys the rule:\n","\n","> At decision time \\(t\\), your inputs may use information up to \\(t\\), and your label must refer strictly to information after \\(t\\).\n","\n","Everything in this notebook is designed to enforce that rule—especially the parts that look boring. For example, normalization: in many ML problems, standardizing using the whole dataset is harmless. In trading, it is a leak, because future distributional information can encode regime changes. Deep nets can exploit that. So we will normalize **inside each fold**, fitted on the training segment only, and we will store the statistics as artifacts so you can prove you did it.\n","\n","**Why we implement the neural net ourselves**\n","\n","You might be thinking: “But no one trains neural nets in pure NumPy.” True. In production you would use a framework. But educationally, frameworks can hide the most important concepts behind abstraction. When you implement even a small MLP yourself, you learn exactly what the optimizer is doing, what gradients mean, why learning rates matter, and how regularization really enters the objective.\n","\n","More importantly, implementing things explicitly forces you to confront the pipeline’s weak points: tensor shapes, label shifts, train/validation boundaries, and the training loop itself. The goal is not to replace PyTorch—it’s to make you *dangerous* in the good sense: capable of reading any deep trading pipeline and spotting where it can cheat.\n","\n","**The notebook’s “professional standard”: governance artifacts**\n","\n","A theme of this book is governance-native research. In this notebook, every run produces a set of artifacts you could hand to a skeptical reviewer:\n","\n","- A run manifest with seeds, versions, config hash.\n","- A data fingerprint that identifies exactly what dataset was used.\n","- A split manifest that records fold boundaries and embargo rules.\n","- A normalization log that proves fit-on-train / apply-forward behavior.\n","- Training traces, checkpoint hashes, and fold-wise results.\n","- Causality assertions and sanity-check outcomes.\n","\n","This is how you move from “I got a good plot” to “I have evidence.”\n","\n","**What success looks like**\n","\n","Success in this notebook is not a single impressive metric. Success is:\n","\n","- Results that are **stable across folds** (not just one lucky period).\n","- Results that are **not fragile across seeds** (or at least whose variability is measured and reported).\n","- A pipeline that **fails loudly** when you introduce leakage and **behaves honestly** when you remove it.\n","- Diagnostics that tell you when you are overfitting and where the model struggles (including simple regime-proxy breakdowns as a preview of Chapter 14).\n","\n","If you come away with that, you’ve learned something more valuable than any one model: you’ve learned a workflow for deep learning in trading that can scale, replicate, and survive skepticism.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ahIzZy1uPijF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##2.LIBRARIES AND ENVIRONMENT"],"metadata":{"id":"tRUoR6FUM_WX"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\"\"\"\n","This cell establishes the computational environment with deterministic behavior.\n","We import only standard library modules and NumPy, set a global seed for\n","reproducibility, and capture environment metadata for governance tracking.\n","\n","The global SEED ensures that every random operation in this notebook produces\n","identical results across runs, which is critical for debugging, auditing, and\n","comparing model variants.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","import numpy as np\n","import random\n","import math\n","import json\n","import os\n","import hashlib\n","from datetime import datetime\n","from collections import defaultdict\n","import itertools\n","import textwrap\n","\n","# Global seed for complete reproducibility\n","SEED = 42\n","np.random.seed(SEED)\n","random.seed(SEED)\n","\n","# Capture environment information for run manifest\n","import sys\n","run_manifest = {\n","    'chapter': 'Chapter 13 - Neural Nets & Deep Learning in Trading',\n","    'python_version': sys.version,\n","    'numpy_version': np.__version__,\n","    'seed': SEED,\n","    'timestamp': datetime.now().isoformat(),\n","    'author': 'Alejandro Reynoso'\n","}\n","\n","print(\"=\"*80)\n","print(\"CHAPTER 13: NEURAL NETS & DEEP LEARNING IN TRADING\")\n","print(\"=\"*80)\n","print(f\"Python Version: {run_manifest['python_version']}\")\n","print(f\"NumPy Version: {run_manifest['numpy_version']}\")\n","print(f\"Global Seed: {SEED}\")\n","print(f\"Run Timestamp: {run_manifest['timestamp']}\")\n","print(\"=\"*80)\n","\n","\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","Governance is embedded from the start.

We constructed a synthetic market data generator that produces realistic financial time series exhibiting volatility clustering, fat tails, and regime dynamics—enabling controlled experimentation without external data dependencies. Through careful feature engineering with strict causality preservation, we transformed raw returns into multi-channel representations suitable for deep learning while preventing all forms of look-ahead bias.\n","\n","**Core Technical Achievements**:\n","\n","The windowed tensor construction demonstrated proper temporal alignment where each window's last timestep corresponds to the decision time, and labels exclusively use future information starting at t+1. We implemented a minimal multi-layer perceptron from scratch, exposing every detail of forward propagation, backpropagation via chain rule, dropout regularization, weight decay, and parameter initialization—demystifying the \"black box\" of neural networks. The training loop incorporated time-safe mini-batching that preserves chronological order, learning rate scheduling for better convergence, and early stopping to prevent overfitting, all while maintaining deterministic reproducibility.\n","\n","**Evaluation Rigor**:\n","\n","Walk-forward validation with embargo periods simulated realistic deployment across multiple temporal periods, testing genuine out-of-sample generalization rather than artificially inflated in-sample performance. Our comprehensive metrics suite—MSE, sign accuracy, Information Coefficient, and Rank IC—captured different dimensions of prediction quality relevant to trading. Sanity checks validated implementation correctness through random labels, permuted features, and normalization leakage detection, while diagnostics revealed learning dynamics, feature dependencies, and regime sensitivity through publication-quality visualizations.\n","\n","**Governance Standard**:\n","\n","Every aspect of execution is documented through cryptographic fingerprints, causality assertions, training traces, and artifact catalogs. The governance framework enables byte-level reproducibility, supports regulatory audit, and establishes transparency standards for quantitative finance research. This \"minimum standard\" approach ensures results are trustworthy, methodology is verifiable, and limitations are explicitly acknowledged.\n","\n","**Key Insight**:\n","\n","Neural networks show modest but real predictive power for returns (IC typically 0.02-0.10), validating their potential while highlighting that prediction alone is insufficient—Chapters 14-20 will integrate regime detection, portfolio optimization, transaction costs, and execution to build complete trading systems. The foundation is solid; now we build upward toward production deployment."],"metadata":{"id":"tsilA_zpqtni"}}]}
